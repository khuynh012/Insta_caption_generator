This one is deeply personal; holding it in my hand is like holding three years of my life. it opens with a longform HONY story— think Tanqueray, think Detra, think Venus— except this time it’s the story of my own attempt to capture the people of this city. The book then expands into four hundred full-color portraits and stories. Unlike previous Humans of New York books: 75 percent of these stories have not been shared online. Dear New York was lovingly created to be the most special thing that’s ever come out of Humans of New York. It will make you think, it will make you laugh, it will make you cry. It’s my love letter to this city, and I can’t wait to share it with you this October. But if you could do me a favor: if you think you’ll be getting Dear New York this fall, consider locking in your order now. Preorders have never been more crucial to helping launch a book into the world. The book has yet to be heavily discounted, but I know Amazon and Barnes and Noble specifically will retroactively apply the inevitable future discounts to your order. Thanks everyone!

It’s a song that I used to sing, and my wife loves it too. So Rita is a product of love between me and my wife. I haven’t seen either of them in a year and a half. When the border opened last year, I sent them both out of the country. I hold a Master’s degree in Burns, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery—and these skills are deeply needed in Gaza. So I chose to stay behind. Now the border is closed, and I couldn’t leave if I wanted to. I do my best to talk to Rita on WhatsApp every day. I’ll ask about kindergarten, and her swimming lessons. I’ll look at her latest drawings, and try to encourage her. But that’s it; I’m a WhatsApp father only. A few days ago she was ignoring me a bit, so I asked: ‘Why don’t you talk to me?’ She told me: ‘I feel like I forgot you a little bit.’ My wife jumped in, and said: ‘No, no, she’s kidding.’ But I said: ‘She doesn’t need to be kidding. She’s saying the truth.’ I’ve been gone most of her life. First with my studies in England, and now with this separation. I do feel guilty, yes. But if I had left, I’d feel even more guilty. There’d be a crack in my heart. It would come to me in my nightmares, every time I saw the suffering of my people. The first stage of this genocide was to destroy the health infrastructure, so there’d be no refuge for the dying. I happen to be part of an organization, Doctors Without Borders, with big abilities and big principles. I knew that if we worked together, and made the right decisions, and did the right things—we’d be able to provide comfort to countless people. And that’s what we’ve done. I’ve co-managed a team that built a field hospital with 120 beds, and three surgical theaters running 24 hours. This is something I’ll be proud of for years and years. And I hope one day Rita will understand. I’ll ask her to read books and watch documentaries about the genocide. I’ll ask her to understand that I couldn’t close my eyes to the suffering of our people. We must resist. And how do we resist? By existing. And how do we exist? By having a value. And in our family, our value is to serve others, more than we serve ourselves.”",38011,758,

When I opened my eyes I thought I’d gone blind. I couldn’t see anything. I could no longer hear their voices. I checked to see if my wife was alive. Her back and legs were fractured, but she was alive. So I turned on the light of my phone and tried to find the children. My three-year-old daughter Julia was calling to me from beneath the rubble: ‘Baba, Baba, where are you?’ I carried her to a safe place then went back for my second son Kareem. He had severe head trauma. He was in a trance. He kept saying: ‘I’m sorry Mama. Please don’t blame me. I’m sorry.’ When I brought them to the hospital, I refused to let my colleagues deal with their injuries. I dealt with them alone. I did the dressing. I removed the sutures. I wanted them to feel: ‘Our dad is taking care of us, maybe he can still protect us. Maybe he’s still our hero.’ We’re doing OK, I guess. My wife is in a wheelchair now; she can’t walk. So I’m everyone’s caregiver. The children’s wounds are healing slowly. But there is a big problem with their brain. They cannot eat well, cannot talk well. Julia is still waking in the night and screaming. Every time she hears a rocket she starts trembling and crying. I used to tell her: ‘Don’t worry. They’re not targeting us.’ It’s a myth that all of us in Gaza tell our children. But it doesn’t work anymore; she knows that it’s a lie.  I’m trying to keep myself together, so they can still see me as their hero. But no, I am not strong now. I’m weak. I’m not eating well. I used to wear better clothes. I’m not OK. There’s so much fear. Fear that they will never recover. If there’s another strike, even near us, they will lose their mind. You understand me? And I have so much guilt, because I’m the reason we stayed. We had a chance to leave Gaza, one year ago. But I refused. Because I love my people. I love my patients, so I chose to stay.  But I regret all of it. My children had the right to live their life. Not this life I chose for them. I’m not okay. I didn’t do well with my children. I didn’t save them or protect them. We used to be a beautiful family.  But now, I don’t know.”",104866,2388,

When I tell you this, it is like I’m seeing it in front of my face on a movie screen. At 3 AM drones appeared outside the windows of the hospital. Most of my colleagues had already fled. I forgive all of them; few beliefs can override the desire to save one’s own soul. But I could not leave. There were hundreds of patients, and few medical staff remaining. If the last of us left, these patients would have died. The hospital staff assembled in the lobby where we were stripped, handcuffed, blindfolded, and marched into the freezing night. Beneath my blindfold I could see hundreds of fighters with machine guns. I could hear the screams of my colleagues being beaten. My fear was so high I was close to cardiac arrest. Someone speaking weak Arabic put a gun to my head and told me I’d never see my children again. He asked: ‘Where is Hamas? Where are the Hostages?’ I told him: ‘I’m just a nurse; I disagree entirely with October 7th.’ But these guys did not care. They beat us all. The lorries came to transport us to the detention center. At the door of the lorry stood the strongest of their fighters, body-builders. And before entering each detainee received the three hardest punches we will ever receive in our lives. When we arrived we were made to lie on the ground, and they put dogs on us. The dogs had muzzles, but we could not see through our blindfolds. All around me was barking and screaming; I thought my colleagues were being eaten. I was detained for several weeks. The conditions were so bad I prayed to die. One of the prison guards, exactly one, I can accept as my neighbor. The rest had hatred in their eyes. Some spoke English; so I tried to reason with them. I pointed out that half of the detainees had debilitating medical conditions. Some were eighty years old. One man was mentally incapacitated. I asked the guards: ‘How could these people possibly be Hamas?’ But for every claim—they’d have a response. Some reason all of us were guilty. Even when I said: ‘I’m a nurse,’ they replied: ‘Oh, so you treated terrorists.’ To them, every Palestinian deserves to suffer. And nothing you say—nothing— will convince them otherwise.”",61528,1657,

She then sent me a written follow-up, which was so moving, and so beautifully written, that I’ve ditched the interview altogether and am including it here in full: “Israel bombed our house into a pile of rubble and dust. Everyone in it— my mother, my father, my four sisters, my brother, my baby niece— became a memory in the same instant. During the war, the home had become our lifeline. Comfort wasn’t always in words. It was in a shared cup of tea in the dark. It was my mother holding our hands, her presence a silent promise that we were not alone. It was my sisters distracting the children with stories. We would huddle together, our physical closeness a shield against the terrifying sounds outside. It’s probably a mercy that the house is now gone, because I don’t think my heart could bear to see the physical emptiness of the rooms where so much life once existed. It’s the ‘unimportant’ moments, the background noise of a living family, that I miss the most. I miss the sound of my father’s key in the door at the end of the day. I miss my mother’s hand on my forehead, checking for a fever that wasn’t there, just out of habit. I miss arguing with Nour about politics and then laughing about it two minutes later. I miss Mona’s quiet smile from across the room, a look that says: ‘I understand. I miss Ayat bursting into my room to show me a funny video. I miss the boys debating which one of them was the better gamer. Where all that beautiful noise used to be—there is nothing but profound silence. If I had one more moment with each of them, I would simply say: ‘Thank you.’ To my father: ‘Thank you for believing in me more than I ever believed in myself.’ To my mother: ‘Thank you for every silent sacrifice I was too young or too busy to notice.’ To my sisters and brothers: ‘Thank you for being the irreplaceable pieces of my childhood and my heart.’ And if I could sit all of them together one more time, the whole family, I would say to them: ‘I see you. I see everything you did for me, for us. And I am so incredibly grateful.”",220508,4070,

Yazan is not a normal boy, he’s very disabled. But he’s the most precious thing I’ve got. Before the war he was improving so much. He was going to therapy. He was making good eye contact. He’s very shy, he cannot express his feelings. But I would take him to visit the neighbors and everyone loved him. He’s a lovely boy: he holds my head, he kisses my cheeks. Right before the war we had a surgery on his legs. At that time he was five years old. When the doctors removed his casts I brought him home from the hospital, and I told my daughters and my wife to close their eyes. When they opened their eyes again, Yazan was walking. We’ll never forget this moment; we had so much hope that he’d be a normal boy. But all the clinics have been closed now for two years. He’s had no therapy. Nothing has been done for him, nothing. Now if he walks three steps he falls down. Before the war he’d started to make sentences with a few words: ‘I need bread, I need water.’ Now if he wants something, he’ll just catch me by the arm and show me. And he’s doing this thing now, where he jerks his arms and legs. This is something we’ve never seen before. We thought we would always go forward. We thought that he would be a normal boy. But now I am watching him deteriorate before my eyes. I have a good job; I work on a medical team. But still, I have no power. It takes all my power just to keep him from dying. Last year he got very bad diarrhea. There was no drinkable water. All of the pharmacies were empty. But I heard of a pharmacy six kilometers away with diarrhea medicine. I was so tired. No car, no fuel, no donkey cart. It was like horrible American action movie: there was bombing, shooting from tanks, shooting from helicopter. But I walked six kilometers, and I got him some medicine. And we managed to stop the diarrhea. Anything he needs, I will do. I have two hands. In one of these hands I carry all the problems of my work, all the problems of the war, raising my four daughters with no food, no water, no shelter, no electricity. And in the other hand, I carry Yazan.” 📸 by @nouralsaqa",54663,1046,

But when the war started my mind changed. Every night I am awakened by airstrikes. I live near the sea, and the helicopters are coming from the sea. Whenever I hear them, I am thinking: ‘What if this one is for me?” And if these shots are for me—how is it going to feel?’ A few months ago my uncles family—they died, to the very last, including the baby. They were sheltering in a school that got bombed. They say when something like that happens, you don’t feel anything. So if it happens to me, this is what I hope. But sometimes you get trapped beneath the rubble. And it takes a long time to die. It’s very scary to think about. For the first time in my life I’ve started to feel like I need someone— someone to tell me that everything’s going to be okay. Four months ago I became engaged. Her name is Lama. She’s the sister of my best friend Kareem, who was killed in a bombing last year. I was driving to her house today. I’d put on jeans, and was smelling very good, and I started thinking: ‘Maybe I shouldn’t be so happy. Because things are so bad for everyone.’ But if I’m being honest, we are very happy. It is maybe even better than being in love in a normal situation. Sometimes when I wake up from the airstrikes: I’ll send her a very sweet message: ‘I hope you are very good,’ and so on. This is something that is nothing during normal times. But it’s a bit different when you are checking if someone is alive. All these things, which used to seem like nothing, are everything to us now. I visit her two or three times a week. Every time I go to her house, we have like five minutes or so.  If she’s upset about Kareem, upset about the situation, afraid of the missiles, I’ll calm her down. I’ll give her a hug. It’s a very great feeling, honestly. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s not going to stop bullets, or bombs, but it makes you feel safe. By that I mean, at least I’m with her and she’s with me. If something happens to me, it is going to happen to her. So we going to be in the same situation. We will live together, or we will die together. And just knowing this, it makes me feel safe.”",66219,1285,

I want to but I can’t, even when my heart is breaking. I used to be a schoolteacher; I love children. But now I see them walking in the streets with no shoes. They come into our clinic and you can see how tired they are. Some of them are mutilated: they’ve lost a leg, or an arm. You see children crying because they cannot walk again. Yes, there is a lot of children like this now. But even the ones who aren’t injured are changing. Before the war it was not normal to find a child who wasn’t in school. There were organizations that would find the parents and force them to enroll. But now Gaza’s children haven’t been to school in two years. They’re changing. They’re beginning to think: ‘I will never go to school. I will just work to bring my family food or water.’ Even my own daughter; she’s twelve years old. She was a leader in school and she dreamed to be a doctor. She has a cousin in Canada, the same age. They have video calls, and my daughter can see the difference. She sees how far behind she’s fallen, and recently she told me: ‘I won’t be a doctor anymore.’ This broke my heart, but still, I could not cry. It’s like something is blocked in me. I don’t share my pain with anyone. I don’t share with my husband. I don’t share with my mother, or my father, or my sister. Because all these people come to me to feel safe. A few months ago when they bombed the house of my husband’s family—I went to collect the body parts. It was too difficult for my husband. He lost fifteen members of his family that day. His mother, his father, his brother, were beneath the rubble. So I went. I had to start looking: this is the head for who? This arm, this leg, is for who? Afterwards I sat alone, and I tried to cry. I felt that if only I could cry, I will feel better. I will feel less full. But even then, I could not.

I decided to focus on my house, my family, my children. When the war started I was working as a data encoder; I spent all day on the laptop. But Doctors Without Borders said to me: ‘Kholoud, there is no one left to ask. We need you to help organize our operations in the North.’ And I’ve done it. I organized a network of people on the ground. Everyone in the organization knows me now, respects me. And I’ve done all of this while raising four children, and another four children who lost their parents. In December we spent fifteen days on the street because there were too many bombs. Nobody could sleep safely inside. I ate nothing during this time, zero. I just drank some water every two days. We were sheltering in a small corridor inside a school yard. My husband left us to look for food, and that’s when the bomb fell. When it falls close to you, you don’t hear anything. You just see the body parts flying through the air: the hand of someone, the leg of someone, the head of someone. My son comes to me and his face is blood. My daughter comes to me and she is clutching her chest. My other two children are holding their legs; I can’t tell how they are injured. There was no hospital left in Gaza City, so I brought them back to our house. Our neighbor is a doctor, so I asked him to come over. We discovered that one of my children had shrapnel in the head. The other three in the leg. There was no anesthesia, no stitches. We put something in the children’s mouth, and I held them down while he removed the shrapnel with the kitchen knife. You cannot imagine how the children were screaming. But we removed the shrapnel. And when we finished, I took the knife, and removed the shrapnel from my own leg. ‘Too kind, too sensitive.’ I heard this my entire life. But I can tell you: another person lives inside you.

From Gaza it’s all bad news: someone’s dying, someone’s been bombed, someone’s been displaced from their home. Then everywhere else in the world, you see things working so smoothly. Everyone is living their lives. Literally the smallest thing that they do: it makes me jealous. The smallest thing, like eating ice cream. This is my favorite food. And I’ve gone two years without any ice cream. I don’t want to feel envious of anyone, so I’m trying not to see it. I’m still trying to treat myself in whatever small ways I can: like doing my hair, or maybe having henna dye on my hands. After work I will try to sit with my sisters, so we can connect, and say about our dreams. One of my dreams is for us all to live on an empty farm, a quiet place outside all the world. Two of our cousins have already passed away in a bombing. Four of my nieces and nephews were injured. I can’t lose anyone else. I can’t, I won’t be able to take it. My family is everything to me. Right now our home is partially destroyed, but we are still living in it. Because we don’t have anywhere else to go. Every day when I come home from work, my two-year old niece is waiting for me at the front door. Her name is Hanan; it means kindness. And when she hugs me it’s like a battery has charged in my heart. Literally all of her life has been in this war. Whenever she hears the sound of a plane, she covers her ears and says: ‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’ She never goes anywhere. She never meets new people. We are her entire world. We do everything we can to protect her, to give her a childhood. Her birthday was two weeks ago. We had dancing all night. There was bombing all around us, but we just turned up the volume and tried to disconnect from all the noise. Sugar is impossible to get in Gaza now; but we gathered all the sugar we could. Everyone contributed. And with this sugar we made a cake, and cinnamon rolls, and sweet tea with mint. Hanan eats nothing but canned food; no snacks, no treats. So when she saw that cake, she started to scream. All the children started to scream; you can’t imagine their joy. It was maybe my best moment ever, in all of the war.”",90469,2184,

She died of cancer when I was eight years old— so I love my name, because my mom loved it. It’s also perfect for me because it means ‘peace, love, and harmony.’ And everyone who meets me says that I’m positive energy shining everywhere. I’m a team leader for twenty-three pharmacists. ‘The pharma army,’ we call it. Ask anyone: we are the happiest team in the hospital. After we start our morning meeting, I’ll put on a bit of music for everyone. If they want to dance, they can dance. If they want to sing, they can sing. We are working 24 hours, seven days a week without stopping. They are under so much stress, all the time. There are always mass casualty incidents. And everyone in Gaza is living their own nightmare: with the bombings, the displacements, the hunger. So I’m just trying to make it easier for them. When I help others, it feels like I’m doing something right, that I’m still useful in this life. In Islam, if you speak a good word to someone else, it is also a good thing for you. So if someone smiles, and says: ‘Good job, you did it, you survived another day.’ This is a big deal for us. So I try to keep a smile from ear to ear. But on the inside, no. I am not happy at all. I haven’t slept for more than three hours since the war began. We are all screwed up in this world. Even if you are still alive in this moment, maybe in five minutes you will die. The smallest spark of light can be destroyed in the blink of an eye. How can anyone be happy when they are surrounded by so much death? But there is something that my mother said to me, right before she died. It’s the only memory that I have of her. She told me: ‘Weam, please keep that smile on your face.

My family lives relatively near the hospital. Usually, when a bombing is that close, I would call them immediately. But on that day I didn’t call. I don’t know why. Maybe I’d grown desensitized. But after an hour I began to notice that the nurses were acting shifty around me. I was summoned to a case in the emergency room, and as we were walking down the hallway, one of the nurses asked if I’d heard from my family. That’s when I knew. I started running to the ER. The first person I found was my father. He’d been in the explosion area; he was stunned. My sister was next to him, she was also in shock. I asked about my mother and the nurse told me that she was in the ICU. It wasn’t true. But that’s what he told me, so he could get me alone. The ICU is three floors up from the ER, so I immediately began running up the stairs. The nurse ran after me. We passed the first floor, the second floor, and then he stopped me forcefully. He told me: ‘I’m sorry. I didn’t know how to tell you. But your mother is deceased.’ I fell to the floor. And I can’t remember everything here, I was in shock. But they brought me to the forensics room and led me to a giant, white bag. I unzipped it. And I saw her face. She looked as good as alive. She had bled out through her legs, so her face was untouched. And I wanted so bad to kiss her in that moment. So I kissed her. And I began to hug her. But they pulled me away and they covered her again. I’m sorry. I’m sorry for the tears. But this is the first time I’ve talked to anyone about this. I have to be strong for my family. Especially because my father is a paraplegic now; it’s a lot of responsibility. I need to be the emotional sponge for everyone else. That’s my focus now: caring for my father, my siblings, my patients. I want to help other people, and be a good Muslim. It’s not that deep. I just have to believe that she’s in a better place.

We’d been displaced. We sat down and had a family discussion, and the consensus in the family was not to leave. We’d just learned that our house was still standing, so we thought: ‘We’re luckier than others.’ One month later the Philadelphi corridor was closed, and the option to leave was exhausted. But we still thought we would be OK. We thought the war would end soon, as we think now, as we thought a year ago, as we thought two years ago. And at least we were together. Our family has always been extremely close. I care for my patients, I care for my friends, but not the way I care for my family. Especially my mother. All people say that their mother is a saint, but she was actually a saint. She hated no one. She loved everyone. When I was a child she worked as a schoolteacher, and her school was next to mine, so in the mornings we would walk to school together. I don’t know why I remember this—but she’d always walk between me and the sun. So that I could stand in her shadow. It’s a simple memory, but it means a lot to me. I was always the most attached to her. Maybe everyone in our family feels the same way, but this is my feeling. I told jokes only for her, so that she would laugh. I specialized in medicine just to make her happy. I was a resilient teenager. I wanted to be a writer. But she confronted me. She told me: ‘Life on Earth is a short journey, and you should help people. Because we believe in God. And we believe there is more than just this life.’ Everything, all the things I have done, I have done to please her. And I let her down. I let her down. Because it was my decision.

I’ve worked in many places with extreme hunger, but what’s so jarring in this context is how cruel it is, how deliberate. I was in Gaza for two months; there’s no way to describe the horror of what’s happening. And I say this as a pediatric ICU doctor who sees children die as part of my work. Among our own staff we have doctors and nurses who are trying to treat patients while hungry, exhausted. They’re living in tents. Some of them have lost fifteen, twenty members of their families. In the hospital there are kids maimed by airstrikes: missing arms, missing legs, third degree burns. Often there’s not enough pain medication. But the children are not screaming about the pain, they’re screaming: ‘I’m hungry! I’m hungry!” I hate to only focus on the kids, because nobody should be starving. But the kids, it just haunts you in a different way. When my two months were finished, I didn’t want to leave. It’s a feeling I haven’t experienced in nearly twenty years of humanitarian assignments. But I felt ashamed. Ashamed to leave my Palestinian colleagues, who were some of the most beautiful and compassionate people that I’ve ever met. I was ashamed as an American, as a human being, that we’ve been unable to stop something that is so clearly a genocide. I remember when our bus pulled out of the buffer zone.

I don’t want to say the relationship fell apart because of our daughter. It was mostly us. We were going through a stressful time: I’d just lost my mother, she’d just lost her grandmother. We were going through an eviction and had to move into a shelter. We just handled our stress in different ways. She dealt with it by wanting to be young and dumb and free. We were arguing about everything, and I’m not good at arguing. I don’t like confrontation. I get agitated, antsy. Every time there was an argument, I’d get so angry that I’d have to leave the facility to get some air. I’ve been that way since childhood. My mom and my dad were heavy addicts; they lost custody of me when I was four. I grew up in programs. I didn’t have nobody to show me affection. And it made me angry, I was an angry kid. I saw that other people had love, and understood it, and to be honest, I wasn’t okay with it. There are times where I still feel like that, sometimes even now as a father. But every time I look at her it goes away. It went away the moment she was born. When you held your first kid, did you see a glow around them? Did you ever see a glow? Because I saw a glow. And I felt it. It was like, holy shit.  I wanted to cry the first time I felt it, because I wasn’t sure what it was. I was confused. But as it gradually grew on me, I was like: OK, so this is what love is. And it felt beautiful. It made me want to be better. I don’t want my daughter seeing the side of me from when I was young and didn’t know how to cope with my anger. Right now I have her every day after school. There’s a counselor at her school: Mr. Gonzalez. I go to see him once, sometimes twice a week. He’s been very helpful. He’s teaching me how to cope with life, how to handle arguments with my baby’s mother. Now if she texts me twenty paragraphs about things that happened six years ago, I don’t fight back. I just don’t respond, until it’s time to get the baby.”",69026,495,

I met this ADORABLE four-month old puppy named Frankie. 

Her mama @emzlabyrinth told me that she’s VERY loving, but also VERY anxious. 

Frankie kept running to hide in between her parents’ legs lol

Emily wasn’t sure if we could get any good photos of her pup… but she welcomed me to try. 

(And you know I love a good challenge)

So we took it very slow, and sure enough, Frankie started to warm up to the camera. 

And once she was safe in her dad’s arms, she let her expressions shine lol

What do you think - did we pull it off?

Okay this is probably one of my fave interactions so far lol. 

You might recall a few weeks ago I shared a photo on my stories of a couple at their wedding, with their dog in a tux in the middle. 🤵‍♂️

I didn’t get to meet their dog that day… but luckily, I spotted them in the crowd at @TheDayOfTheDog festival and approached them. 

That’s when I met Hank - a certified good boy with a heart of gold. 💛

When Ryan and Jamie got him, they thought he was 100% Cockapoo. 

Turns out, he’s a unique mix of a bunch of different breeds (which makes him even cuter!) 

Here’s some fun facts about Hank: 
🎂 Almost 3 years old
🐾 Mix: Cockapoo, Maltese, Havanese, Fox Terrier
🐺 Is convinced he’s a wolf
✈️ Small enough to travel in the plane
🍏 Food motivated (except for apple treats lol)

Usually when I do street portraits and photograph dogs, it’s a lot quieter.

But this all went down in the middle of a busy crowd, which means this interaction went off the rails many times 😂 

But that’s okay! I had a smile on my face the whole time. 

And those howls at the end? 

🫠🫠🫠🫠

So adorable lol. 

I’m so glad I ran into you guys again - and thanks for letting me snap your photos! 🙏

@jamiehartwell.pt @rhealey1988

P.S. I tried to find the dog in the Tutu (at 0:29) after I was done photographing Hank, but it was so busy that I couldn’t find her. 

If she (or her owner) happens to read this, send me a message! I owe you a photo 😭

I was at @TheDayofTheDog event in Yaletown when Chanel came up and said hello. 

These events are always crazy (in a good way), with tons of dogs, people and excitement… so I thought I could blend in with the crowd. 

But I guess standing there with a @sonyalpha camera, a huge smile and bright @vessi shoes kinda gave me away. 😂

That’s when she introduced me to her sister Princess - and her dog, Tofu (@hello.tofu).

Tofu is a six-year old American Eskimo pup. ❄️

He loves chicken, sleeping, swimming and posing for the camera. 

Tofu also LOVES people. He gets to hang out in an office all day, and greets everyone as they walk by. 

But dogs? He’s a little picky (depending on the breed). 😂

During our photoshoot, Tofu kept running up to the camera for his close-up, so I had to include one (even if it’s a little out of focus lol). 

But my fave shot came near the end. 

We were trying to get Tofu to smile, but he kept giving us this face: 😐

(Understandable, as he was probably getting sick of people calling him cute all day lol)

But when they picked him up, and gave him a big kiss, he let out the BIGGEST smile. 

Thanks for saying hi that day, @imyourprincess_ & @chaneldazo!

Was a pleasure to meet all three of you. 🙏

For the first time ever, I barely had to approach anyone...

Met Kiefer and Nika chilling in the shade in Kitsilano on a hot summer’s day. Nika was standing there, looking like she owned the block. 

Nika is a 1-year-old husky mix with more energy than my camera battery. 

She loves spending her time at the beach chasing waves, sunsets and other dogs. 

She was such a great little model - and just look at that tongue! 

Plus she loved the smell of my @sonyalpha A7CII 😂 

And as a bonus - a few minutes later we ran into Nika’s mom and got a quick photo of them together.

Met Jessa and her superstar pup Tina in Yaletown recently. 

Tina’s a 10.5-year-old husky/shepherd mix with a heart of gold and two brand new ACLs. 

She’s been with Jessa since puppyhood—moved all the way from Winnipeg to Vancouver. 

“Best decision ever”, Jessa says. 

Tina keeps her active, keeps her smiling, and makes the city feel friendlier. 

Tina nailed her model pose (and her big paw trick). 

She was such a fantastic model, so she got lots of treats that day. 

Matching smiles, a few kisses, and a whole lot of love. 

Jessa’s got the best sidekick. 

And Tina? She’s got the best mom.

I met this little angel named Molly in Vancouver recently. 

This dog is a 10-year old Toy Poodle rescue who spent most of her life in a puppy mill. 

Now she spends her days comfortably at home, patiently waiting for her parents to get off work so they can explore the city together. 🌇

Molly enjoys the simple things in life…

Sniffing the grass, walking in the shade and taking in the sights of the city. 

Molly wasn’t fond of people or pets when they first adopted her, but she’s made a ton of progress in the last six months, now she’s confident and social. 💪

This pup doesn’t bark, and stays quiet as a mouse. 🐭

Molly is missing her teeth, so her tongue just kinda hangs out on the side. 

She doesn’t seem to mind though… plus I think it adds character to her already cute demeanour. 😜

Even random people have stopped their car in traffic to yell out to say how much they love her. 

I’m glad this pup will get to spend the rest of her days feeling loved & appreciated. ❤️

That’s when I met Lilly, Monica (@Shmiligan), and Cheese (@Cheesethemighty). 

Yes, Cheese 🧀

Cheese is a four year old Chihuahua with calm confidence. 

Lilly told me that Cheese has “BDE”

Big Dog Energy 😂

And she was right, because despite all the craziness of the event, Cheese seemed totally chill and unbothered. 

He didn’t have a care in the world, even when a total stranger was taking his portrait. 

When I noticed him shaking a little bit, Lilly said he’s just on vibrate mode lol 😂

Lilly describes this little man as her soul mate, which makes sense because you can clearly see the love they have for one another.

This interaction is definitely special. 

Diana and I were about to head home after a long day of photographing dogs downtown.

But we both forgot where I parked 😂

And as we were wandering around looking for my car, this beautiful Border Collie was crossing the street in front of us. 

Diana and I were mid-conversation, and out of nowhere this dog started going crazy and pulling frantically towards us. 

I wasn’t ready to take more photos, and my battery was at 5% lol

But as soon as I saw how excited this dog was, I couldn’t say no. 🥹

That’s when I met Carlotta (@carlottacrestanello) and Zoey (@zoeysauce_bordercollie). 

Zoey is a 5 year old Border Collie who is very smart, super expressive (and VERY sassy lol). 

Carlotta was having a pretty rough day, but seeing Zoey do happy dances put a big smile on her face. 

And once she saw the photos, she was happy to let me share them. 

Carlotta thinks Zoey recognized me since she watches my videos with Zoey laying next to her - so she may have recognized my voice. 

I’m still not used to getting recognized by people…

But being recognized by a dog?!

Leo and I were both fighting back tears, so maybe skip this one if you’re not in the right head space for it.

Leo lit up in front of the camera. 

Warm. Playful. Kind. 

As we talked, Leo shared the meaning behind the tattoos…

Stories of family, identity, and grief. 

The symbol for “equality” proudly inked on their neck.

Before we wrapped up, I asked if they had any advice for someone my age. 

About how to navigate the next chapter of life.

And Marika? What a gem. She was rushing to get home to host an event, but was still happy to take a few minutes for photos. 💎

https://www.instagram.com/p/C6ZYTL9LfT3/,modelstrangers,2024-04-30,img1,"It’s turned out to be a wonderful year for Anne since I stopped her outside Belfast City Hall back in January. 

Her @modelstrangers video went viral (over 40 million views on all social media platforms). Not only did it give my own Instagram page a big boost, but she has been offered many exciting opportunities.

She has become a celebrity of sorts around Belfast, being stopped by people who have thanked her for being an inspiration to them. She has also been asked to model for @kindredofireland and has even been signed with @acamodels! 

Not forgetting that just recently we appeared on @bbctheoneshow together. 

I can’t overstate how proud I am of her. 

One of the things I have noticed about Anne is that even though she is quite a shy and retiring person, who struggles like many of us with self-esteem, she is always open to trying new experiences and treats things outside of her comfort zone with a calm level-headedness and professionalism. 

Anne has proved that grace, beauty and intelligence know no age. She is so warm and friendly and kind, and she deserves all the good things that have happened to her. 

Thank you Anne for saying yes to me on that cold January afternoon. It was indeed meant to be.

Retired nurse, tending plants outside her stone house, surrounded by stray cats. Neighbors say she's become part of the community, caring for flowers and feeding wild cats. Initially hesitant, she smiled warmly, reflecting kindness and new life.

Sometimes our facial expressions can lead others to form quick prejudices about us. A serious, preoccupied, or nervous look in a single moment might create a wrong perception, when in reality it’s just a fleeting state of mind.
In this series of portraits with Gerald, I wanted to capture exactly that kind of expression, because I felt it gave him character and strength. But going a bit further with more photo shoots, I also captured his genuine smile, his gentle demeanor, and the soft warmth of a man with so much love inside. To me, both sides are remarkable and poetic in their own way.
We all have many aspects of our lives reflected in our faces.

She told me this almost shyly, like she knew it’s not exactly what people expect from someone her age. She wants to be out on a fishing boat, pulling in kilometres of nets, getting covered in fish guts and seawater... and loving it. It’s gritty, it’s real, and honestly? It’s kind of badass. Not your average dream, but a seriously cool one. Big respect to Kajsa for following her own path, an inspiration for anyone who’s not afraid to do life a little differently.

You have to capture it. This was one of those moments when life casually drops a movie scene right in front of you. This was D·Moment I met Espen and his gorgeous Alaskan Malamute, Fenris, walking along the same path we were hiking in the beautiful countryside of Southern Norway. Espen looked like a Viking who had swapped his battle axe for a perfectly fitted sweater, and Fenris had that regal “wolf prince” aura that made you stop and stare. Together, they moved with such harmony, the rolling fields behind them felt like a set built just for this shot. Honestly, it might have been one of the most naturally perfect photo shoots I’ve ever stumbled upon.

What about you, what would you do in that moment? Would you just stand there in awe, approach them to ask for some photos, or even just tell them how cool they are? 📸🐺",13725,289,

I met her just after she had finished a work interview, something she casually mentioned as we got to talking. Right away, there was a quiet confidence about her. She was calm, kind, and carried herself with a simplicity that felt genuine. Nothing flashy, just real.

During the shoot, there was this moment where she put on a pair of glasses, and it was surprising how something so small could shift a person’s look so much. It wasn’t just her appearance that changed, but the whole vibe she gave off, more focused, maybe even a bit sharper, yet still that same humble presence.

It reminded me how much of a story someone’s look can tell, especially when it’s effortless. Udeme didn’t need to try hard, she had that natural grace that speaks louder than words.

If there’s one person who comes to mind when I think of the true beauty of Italy, the kind that speaks straight to the heart, it’s Dario Cecchini. The Butcher. One of the most lovely, genuine, and warm souls I’ve ever had the chance to meet.

Dario’s humble spirit, his boundless energy, and his deep love for people are something rare. The way he connects, entertains, and uplifts, with that rich, sincere voice and a soul as colorful as his style, feels like poetry in motion. He embodies what it means to give unconditionally.

The D•Moment with him wasn’t just about capturing an image. It was about experiencing a moment of pure authenticity. A reminder that when you pour your heart into something without expectation, the return can be something priceless: an unexpected friendship and a memory that stays with you forever.

with Cynddi & Matias 💃🏼🕺🏼

On a day of January 2024 I found myself wandering the streets of Buenos Aires, and out of nowhere, two tango dancers caught my eye. They weren’t just performing, they were connecting. Every step, every pause, felt like poetry in motion. I don’t know much about dance, let alone tango, but what I saw felt like watching a noir love story unfold without words.

There was intimacy, tension, grace… something raw and real. It made me wonder how often we witness something truly human without realizing it.

I used to be a student dreaming of making a living through photography — of traveling the world, discovering new cultures, and finding the courage to talk to strangers.

Then I spent a year working a 9–5 job in finance, holding on to the dream of escaping and truly living — of seeing the world with my own eyes.

and here we are now, 1 million people acknowledging my work 🥲

I wish I could tell that younger Bleg that he’s on the right path.
That his shyness is actually his strength.
That the voice he used to hate would one day be the reason people connect with him.
That real connections come when the time is right.
and that everything is possible if you put your heart to it

To everyone I’ve photographed, to everyone I’ve met on the path, to everyone who follows the journey — thank you 🤍

I promise to always stay true to my values and to keep going as long as my heart tells me to

I don’t care about being famous. I don’t care about the money.
What matters is that I feel peace within, and that I stay aligned with what feels right.

Thank you to my family and friends who always encouraged me 🥲
Thank you @oe_glitter for being the first person I ever approached that way 🤍
Thank you @papesan for giving advices when I needed the most 🤍
Thank you @jenybsg for encouraging me to take the leap and quit my job 🤍
Thank you to my mom and my brother, who gave me the money to buy my first camera 

And thank you — whoever’s reading this right now.
I wish you nothing but health, peace, and happiness 🤍

The journey has just begun 

with Love,

저는 포토그래퍼입니다
(아마도 이 말을 제가 제일 많이 했을 거예요)
I’m a photographer.
(You must have heard this sentence a ton of times from me)
---
한국에서 만난 모든 분들이 저에게 말했어요.
“여기서 좋은 추억 많이 만들길 바란다”고.
Everyone I met in Korea told me,
“I hope you’ll make good memories here.”

정말 그렇게 됐어요. 기대했던 것보다 훨씬 더요.
And I truly did — more than I ever expected.

가장 영감을 주는 사람들을 만났고,
평생 간직할 우정을 쌓았어요.
I met the most inspiring souls,
and made friendships I’ll carry for life.

절대 잊지 못할 순간들을 함께 나눴습니다.
And shared moments I’ll never forget.

정말 감사합니다.
Thank you so much.

이 여정 속에서 제 길을 스쳐간 모든 분들께,
To every single person who crossed my path on this journey:

여러분의 친절과 시간, 그리고 에너지에 진심으로 감사드립니다.
Thank you for your kindness, your time, your energy.

여러분은 저에게 소중한 조각으로 남아 있어요.
You’ve all left a piece of yourselves with me.

어디를 가든 여러분을 마음에 간직할게요.
I promise I’ll carry you wherever I go.

곧 다시 만날 수 있을지도 몰라요… 👀
See you soon… maybe 👀

""Dunes Like You"", Dubai, 2016 // Photo: © Scarlett Hooft Graafland

Scarlett Hooft Graafland is a Dutch visual artist known for her dreamlike, site-specific photographs that blend performance, sculpture, and landscape. 

In ""Dunes Like You"" (2016), taken in the deserts of Dubai, she places a group of figures draped in vibrant fabrics across an expanse of sand, their forms echoing the curves of the surrounding dunes, resulting is a surreal and poetic composition that blurs the line between nature and the human presence within it.

""Rush"", Kolkata, India // Photo: © Marius Burgelman / @mariusburgelman_

This striking photograph by Brussels-based photographer Marius Burgelman, selected as an Editor's Pick in our Street Photography award this Spring, depicts a moment of life on the frenetic streets of Kolkata, capturing the tension between motion and stillness beautifully. 

At its center, a yellow taxi—emblematic of the city—sits unmoved, its driver meeting the viewer’s gaze with an arresting calm, while around him, the figures of passersby dissolve into streaks of motion, rendered ghostlike by a slow shutter speed. The composition becomes a visual metaphor for urban life itself: fleeting and relentless, yet punctuated by moments of quiet clarity and connection.

Unseen, , 2024// Photo: © Jungjin Lee / @jungjin_voice
⁠
Jungjin Lee’s Unseen  (2024), like much of her Unseen series, resists fixed geographic identifiers. The image appears to depict Iceland’s iconic Kirkjufell, but it is stripped of literal detail and captions, rendered instead in textured monochrome that reflects the South Korean artist's deeply introspective and philosophical engagement with the landscape.

Bronx, NYC, C. 1970s // Photo: © Camilo José Vergara / @nodrybones

Camilo José Vergara is a pioneering photographer and sociologist whose images of 1970s New York City form one of the most important visual records of urban America in decline. 

With a systematic approach more akin to sociology than traditional photojournalism, he documented the crumbling infrastructure, abandoned buildings, and resilient communities of neighborhoods like the South Bronx, Harlem, and Bushwick—at a time when many had written them off entirely.

Rather than sensationalize, Vergara sought to understand. His photographs, often shot in stark natural light and composed with unflinching directness, reflect a deep respect for place and people. They are not just images of decay, but of endurance—bearing witness to cycles of neglect and renewal, and challenging the viewer to confront uncomfortable truths about race, poverty, and urban policy.

Untitled, Sweden // Photo: © Isabella Ståhl / @isabella.stahl

Isabella Ståhl is a Swedish photographer whose work offers a hauntingly poetic vision of the Nordic landscape. 

Rooted in the forests, fields, and rural outskirts of Sweden, her images evoke a sense of quiet solitude and ethereal beauty. Often shot in soft, muted tones and natural light, they blend documentary with dreamlike elements—blurring the line between reality and reverie. - this is enough

Taken during the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, this surreal and haunting image by Czech photographer Josef Koudelka captures a fleeting, fragile moment of innocence amid the chaos of political upheaval. A young boy, dressed in makeshift angel wings, rides a bicycle through an empty street, a silent figure caught between fantasy and reality, peace and oppression.

Shot with Koudelka’s signature immediacy and intuitive framing, the image is rich in symbolism. The wings evoke purity and vulnerability, while the stark urban backdrop hints at a world that has lost its innocence. It’s a quietly powerful reminder of the personal, human dimension of historical trauma, and a testament to Koudelka’s ability to find poetry in the most unlikely places.

Man and Taj Reflection, India, 1999 // Photo: © Steve McCurry / @stevemccurryofficial

True to his obsessive drive to document the social landscapes of his time, Steve McCurry—armed with both a real passport and a metaphorical one—has helped shape the visual narratives of numerous countries. Yet, it is India that has remained the cornerstone of his artistic journey. It was here, as a young man not long out of university, that he laid the foundations of his practice. Since then, he has returned frequently, capturing breathtaking images of its landscapes, people, and daily life, photographs that remain among the most iconic in his extraordinary oeuvre.

It makes a certain amount of sense for you to be with God on Valentine’s Day. Your name, Zohra, in Arabic means a flower blossom. I miss you so much, Muyma. You raised 5 sons, and I was extra credit. You’d be proud of the man I’ve become. I try to make people happy every day in our home city.

I’ve just met @kevinhart4real and edited/posted a reel on the spot. The views are going crazy. I’m packing up my equipment at Xfinity live.

A girl sitting nearby tips her 40oz beer, and it gets all over my laptop and camera. I’m panicking. What do I do now? I don’t even have a press pass to get into the stadium. Every high-level contact I have says there’s nothing they can do.

I wipe everything down, pack up my bag, and start walking towards the Linc. My mother would always say, “What’s the worst they can say? No.” Let me just see what they say.

Headphones playing Dreams & Nightmares by @meekmill full-blast on repeat. I feel the spirit of my grandmother who raised me in the sky & wind. Holding back tears I get to the gate.

“I’m South Street Sam.” They let me in. It was the will of God.

Boundaried yet open, it remains rooted in its essence.

I liked to believe that I am their guide who has been given the responsibility to safely transport these people to their new beginnings.  These people’s lives are in my hands and I take that very seriously. With love we will safely get them to their new homes 🏠 🫂🧑‍✈️

 I can’t believe @pepethepilot took the camera. I am so honored.  So much respect for you my brother! My new friend.",707646,2002,pilot | disposablecamera | shotonfilm | flying | pilotlife | travel | panama

It's all about the process of doing and creating, and seeing the results of our efforts. That's why diving into creative activities brings us so much joy. It comes from what we do—whether it's photography, painting, football, or music. 🎶 Music is the perfect metaphor: it's fluid, here one moment and gone the next, yet it fills us with joy.

When I'm out there capturing those candid moments, I need a camera that's unobtrusive and lets me keep my hands free for my photo camera. Enter the GoPro Hero 8 Black! 📸✨

Why do I love it? The image quality and stabilization are top-notch, and the sound quality is so good I don't even need an external mic. The only downside? Battery life. Usually, I carry 5-6 batteries with me. 🔋🤪

My secret weapon? The GoPro chest mount! Just flip out the levers of your GoPro, screw it to the chest mount and you're good to go. I even wear a jacket over it for extra stealth mode. Almost looks like a fashion piece, right? 😉

I always have my trusty backpack with me for all my gear. That's my setup in a nutshell! Got more questions? Drop them in the comments, and I'll be happy to answer.

Don’t get stuck, don’t overthink It, go out start working, make mistakes, your work will be crap at first; It’s fine my work every time I start something new Is junk, absolute junk. I have to throw away so many photographs and I’m embarrassed and thank God you will not see them, nobody will see them but just wade through It, just keep going, and In the case of photography you know sooner or later the world will whisper In your ear and say let me show you something far more interesting than your little Idea, let me show you a much better way of dealing with the world, of seeing the world, so but you have to prepared to listen, to be out there and working and listening, It will come, you just have to keep going and keep at It, make mistakes make errors, get through the bad work, and then the good work arrives. Just look for It. It will arrive.

Dropped into Zam Bazar Market, Chennai—with the Fujifilm X-Half in hand and Kiruba capturing every behind-the-scenes moment. This reel is a visual conversation between two perspectives—one shooting the street, the other filming the photographer.

Shooting with the X-Half brings back that film-like experience—you don’t preview your shots; instead, you develop the “roll” later using the app. Every frame is a surprise. The 2-in-1 diptychs, film simulations like Classic Chrome, Classic Neg, Acros, and those nostalgic filters give every photo a timeless, cinematic feel.

Curious cats, a banana vendor mid-sale, a woman painting drishti poosanikai, and the everyday poetry of a bustling market—this reel captures it all in half frames but with full emotion.

🎞️ Camera: Fujifilm X-Half
📽️ BTS & Edit: Kiruba
🎨 Film Sim: Classic Chrome / Classic Neg / Acros + Nostalgic Filters

Daniel reflected on the joy and fulfillment he experienced during the height of his online popularity, while also acknowledging the need to move beyond curating a public persona. They also discussed his forthcoming book, You Are What You Do (Loose Joints). Though Daniel had a strong instinct to maintain control over his work, he came to appreciate how working with an editor—bringing in a more objective eye—could open the work up to new ideas and take it in directions he might not have pursued on his own.

Arnold’s pursuit of the human moment reveals an artist of emotional range in a city alive with contradiction and complexity, where the chaos, humour and vitality that define New York interact with a tenderness and empathy that courses through every frame. From pure street cinema to candid images from fashion shoots and film sets, Arnold’s wry, tragicomic style is edited by @sarahpespenon as you’ve never seen before in this elegant landscape hardcover.

I've always been inspired by his storytelling, his approach to philosophy, his removal from the technical aspects of photography and his recognition of the emotional. I even wanted to emulate my own YouTube channel on his model. 

Well, after buying his book The Meaning in the Making, I reached out to thank him. I was listening to it in the Autumn of 2023, as I was preparing to leave the US and return to Scandinavia. With his voice in my ears, I found my way to local museums close to where I used to live. I rediscovered reading. And I started finding art outside of photography. 
In my transition, he inspired me to reconnect with myself and my work. 

Since then we've talked a bit here and there. Just a few exchanges but I told him to hit me up, if he ever visited Copenhagen. 

A few months ago, he took me up on that offer. 
Except, he asked to visit me in Sweden and to make one of his incredible YouTube documentaries about me and this time and place I am in my life. 
Two days, hours of conversation going late into the night and a lot of sourdough bread later, the resulting documentary floored me! 

I had already told him I was going to photograph him as well, and before he arrived, I knew it would be out in the forest. 
I wanted to capture a bit of the soulfulness I and so many other, have gotten to witness over the years. 

Sean, thank you for being willing to explore the chaos of the life I'm currently living. I find it serendipitous that you came to visit right as I've found my way back home, to myself, after my decade abroad. 

If you haven't already, go check out his channel, his book and the video he made about me. It's all quite worthwhile! I promise.",2842,71,

In this edition I share a series of images featuring some of the more colourful characters I’ve come across on the streets over the years. I talk about how we can approach capturing subjects within the frame, and why human beings love to weave imaginary stories about the lives of others.  

I also talk about how we’re each given roles to play in our lives, and how self knowledge is the path to discovering both the part we were born to perform, and what we each have to contribute to the world.

PARABLE vol.6 is printed on environmentally-friendly, uncoated paper giving a pleasing matt feel in the hand, and muted hues with lifted, charcoal blacks to the rendering of the images. This edition is 48 sides at a large A4 size with staple binding.

OR you can download the digital version which features a PDF and an mp3 file of me reading the magazine to you.

This 20-frame carousel is my love letter to the city a study in light, shadow, movement, and character, captured through the streets I know best. Every scene is a reminder that photography is as much about patience and presence as it is about pressing the shutter.

For this series, I teamed up with @bh.creators and @sigmaphoto to put the Sigma 50mm f/1.2 Art to work in the real world.
Why this lens stands out:
• f/1.2 aperture Dreamy bokeh and razor-thin depth of field, perfect for isolating your subject in a busy city.
• Fast, accurate autofocus. Locks on instantly, even in fleeting street moments.
• Exceptional color & contrast. The tones come alive straight out of camera.
• Prime lens discipline, Forces you to move, frame, and think differently, making you more intentional with every shot.

Shooting with a prime at golden hour in LA isn’t just about what you see,
it’s about finding the rhythm between light and shadow, letting the city reveal its quiet stories. From strangers on the sidewalk to murals that feel alive in the sun, this lens made it possible to capture each moment with clarity and emotion.

If you’re looking to push your photography further, challenge yourself with a prime lens, study the light, and let the shadows guide your frame.

This is what it feels like to move through a city.
I didn’t want to freeze time I wanted to let it bleed.

This 20-image series was created using the OM System OM-3, leveraging its computational slow shutter feature and built-in ND filters to capture the vibrant energy of motion turning everyday moments into emotional surrealism.

It’s not just long exposure it’s Expressionist photography.

Faces blur. Light bends. Time stretches.
This isn’t what the city looks like 
It’s what it feels like.

Shot handheld, in-camera, with no external filters or post overlays.
Just movement, intuition, and the right tool in hand.

Juxtaposition in street photography refers to placing contrasting elements side by side within the frame to create a visually compelling or thought-provoking image. It often involves capturing unexpected moments or situations that highlight the disparities or similarities between different elements in the scene.

YES ! 
While street photography often captures candid moments of people in public spaces, it doesn’t necessarily require human subjects. It can also focus on urban landscapes, architecture, or other elements without featuring people directly but should be “fluid” in nature.
Street photography is about HUMAN CONDITION, and not really HUMANS, The choice depends on your voice and artistic choices you make.

'New York Street Diaries' is an evocative illustrated book that reveals a rarely seen side of the Big Apple: calm, quiet, and deeply human. 

@philpenman captures the city during the great snowstorm and the Corona lockdown, creating striking visual records of moments that reshaped life in New York.

British-born Penman has photographed the city for over two decades, from portraits of icons like Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Bill Gates to his unforgettable documentation of September 11, 2001. 

His black-and-white photographs capture New York at its most sensitive and intimate, far from the noise and bustle. With refreshing directness, his images bring the viewer so close they feel part of the scene.

Lavishly produced in large format, 'New York Street Diaries' is a tribute to the people and streets of New York. A must-have coffee table book for lovers of the city, and an unforgettable gift.

Phil Penman's 'Street Scenes’ is released early September.

'New York Street Diaries' is available via link in bio.",3203,52,

After a quick Google search, my suspicions were confirmed. This, in fact, is THE Daria. The one I grew up with on the radio. 

It brought me back to the days I’d jam out to Smashing Pumpkins & Green Day, jumping around, pretending a tennis racket was a guitar. 

The days I’d lay on the floor, cassette tape loaded into my boombox, ready to record if that one Blink 182 or No Doubt or Bush song happened to be played on 94.7 KNRK. 

And the cold mornings in 1998 when I’d jump in the car and sit there listening to Daria while my car defrosts. And she was still there while I was driving to my high school, stuck in a standstill on 217, thinking, “Yup. I’m gonna be late.”

Daria, you are an icon.

The contest is open to photographers, filmmakers, digital artists, and AI creators, with over $30,000 in prizes and opportunities for every skill level.

Flow reveals itself everywhere in footsteps crossing at dusk, in headlights tracing lines through the night, or in a fleeting glance exchanged in motion. For me, photography is about catching these passing rhythms, moments that move yet linger.

I look forward to seeing how you bring your vision of flow to life!

The founders of @pure.street.photography — @dimpy.bhalotia and @kamalkumaarrao — are on a mission to uplift underprivileged children through the transformative power of street photography. In collaboration with @sakshatfoundation, they conduct special photography camps across India to introduce street photography to children who’ve never held a camera before. 

What began with a deep love for the art form has become a heartfelt initiative to ignite creativity, confidence, and self-expression in young minds who deserve the chance to be seen and heard.

Our vision is to scale these camps and create long-term impact — by providing resources, and opportunities for every child to explore their creative potential. But we can’t do it alone.

Your donation can spark a life-changing journey.

Help us reach more children, nurture hidden talent, and build a future where creativity belongs to everyone.

With this idea we decided to go with a more decentralized curation model, forming a team of proven artists and curators from the traditional and digital art worlds.

Introducing “Welcome Home”, a collaboration between @Chucha.Studios and @blackarchives.co, dedicated to preserving the rich narratives of Black immigrant families. This installment honors the legacy of George Carty, affectionately known as Uncle George, a Trinidadian immigrant who built his life and community in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn alongside Omari (@m_u_z)

Through archival photography and storytelling, we bring his family’s journey to life—tracing back to the 1920s migration of his grandparents from Trinidad to Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance. Their lineage is one of resilience, service, and creativity, culminating in the family home - a living testament to the power of Black history, migration, and cultural preservation.
“Welcome Home” is more than just a tribute—it’s a call to honor our histories, preserve our stories, and celebrate the legacy of Black immigrants. Watch the full story unfold. 
Join us in our effort to keeping these stories alive by sharing your family archival photos to celebrate your family’s heritage.

Expo, Talk et Présentation du nouveau livre de Soulayl A : « Gangsta dating story » aux éditions LOCO.

Jeune photographe Souhayl A s’immerge durant plusieurs semaines au coeur dun gang des rappeurs de Miami du nom de « Sex Money Murder ». Il délivre un récit post documentaire d une force ennuie. Des images qui décryptent  les codes qui opèrent dans ce milieu ultra fermé mais aussi la culture RAP outre Atlantique. Ce qui donne un autre visage d une Amérique que beaucoup d éditorialistes refusent de monter dans les médias dominants. 

AU MENU : 

Installation immersive en collaboration avec le compositeur Alice Orpheus. 

Une signature et dédicace de l’ouvrage « Gangsta Dating Story » faite sur place par l artiste lui même. 

Une table ronde en diffusion streaming en présence de l Auteur, de rappeurs et des tatoueurs français pour parler des thématiques suivantes : 

- Le Gang pure produit de l hyper capitalisme US ? 
- « Sex Money Murda » un gang parmi les plus violents au monde que les autorités US peine à démanteler. 
- Le RAP un milieu misogyne et violent ? (Analyse et décryptage des différents stéréotypes.) 
- Le Gangsta Rap un instrument culturel d emprise et de recrutement au service des gangs ou un outil légitime de revendications sociales ? 
- Rapports H/F et représentation des genres dans le milieu musical du Rap.
- Décryptage des codes de séduction operant à l intérieur des gangs à l’aune du scandal « Puff Daddy » et dans une société occidentale post « MeToo » 
- Mon experience de photographe à l intérieur du gang SMM. 

Un grand merci à la galerie Rachel Hardouin @15martelparis pour son implication et son accueil de l event. 

Un remerciement chaleureux pour mon éditeur @loco_editions pour avoir cru à ce projet dès le départ.

Always on duty, always watching over the people with a gentle smile.
He’s not just kind  he’s the kind of person who makes your day better just by being there.

So many people know him and stop by just to say hi.
That already says a lot about the kind of soul he is.

The other day, I asked him,
“Why are you still working?”
I thought maybe it was for money or something…
But he smiled and said,
“I’m already retired. I just get bored staying home all day.”
I think that’s something related to Japanese culture.
Even if they don’t need to work, many people still do,
because they find meaning and joy in staying active and being part of society.😊

Anyway,
if you ever visit Japan and see him in Shibuya,
go say hi.
He’s truly a good man. 🥹

จากที่ไปทำมาที่ชอบมากๆของที่นี่ก็คือเค้าให้ความเป็นส่วนตัวสุดๆ เพราะเป็นระบบนัดหมายล่วงหน้าเท่านั้น ทำให้ไม่ต้องรอนาน ไม่วุ่นวาย บรรยากาศสงบ เหมาะกับการพักผ่อนและฟื้นฟูตัวเองแบบเต็มที่จริงๆฮะ ซึ่งคุณหมอบอกว่าจะเห็นผลชัดเจนขึ้นอีก หลังทำไปแล้ว 6-12 สัปดาห์ 🫶🏻",3,24,HouseofWelle | ultheraprime | tavepong_street

.
Sony Singapore invited me to experience the 2025 World Aquatics Championships in Singapore 🏊🏻‍♂️
.
At first, I planned to do something different—bring a small lens and snap street-style shots of the atmosphere around the event. But once I got there, I realized that during the competitions, you can’t really walk around freely. Access was quite limited.
.
So this ended up being my first time shooting sports with a super telephoto lens. And even though it was my first experience, the A1 II and A9 III worked seamlessly with the FE 300mm f/2.8 GM and FE 400mm f/2.8 GM—a fantastic combo ⚡️
.
Big thanks to @sonysingapore and @sonythai for giving me this amazing new experience.
I had such a great time!

PS.For the first photo is not a single shot , it’s a composite made from a 1-second burst using the Sony A1 II

It's a self-portrait I took in the mirror with Canon T90 after I got back from covering the September 11th attacks. My elbow was bleeding from running and falling, I was covered in dust from the fallen South Tower across the street where I was standing, and I was pregnant. I mixed the developer and fixer and developed my two rolls of black-and-white Tri-X film in the bathroom. Then, with the film still wet in the tank, I walked to work at the Associated Press. ""BW?"" My boss asked, clearly surprised. (At the time, news wire only used color photos.) I explained that I had a roll of color film that I wasn't aware I was using, and we developed it that day at the Time lab.

Swipe to see some of the iconic photos I made that day.

Can you recall where you were or how you felt on September 11, 2001?

Her images, shaped by a perspective of migration and cultural hybridity, focus on subtle gestures and quiet resilience, revealing how everyday rhythms transform the urban environment.

Most of us will remember that in late August of 2005, a hurricane of historical tragic force hit the Southern United States and in particular New Orleans. 

I was in New York and immediately took the first flight to Baton Rouge. I was amazed that I was able to rent a car and drive straight in to the city. When I arrived thousands of people were stranded at the cities convention center and the Super Dome, and all over the region. I immediately saw scenes that reminded me of disaster zones I had scene in many other parts of the world that didn’t have economic means and infrastructure like the US. 

I was outraged that so many people had to suffer for so long without aid and without the Bush administration reacting quickly to come to their rescue. I always suspected (and knew) that if this type of tragedy had struck one of the more affluent locals in America that aid would have been mobilized so much quicker. 

When I arrived at the New Orleans Convention Center where thousands of people were stranded without food and water for several days-I witnessed a rescue scene with military helicopters and personal. It actually reminded me of scenes I had seen in Somalia in 1992. 

I was working on assignment for Harper’s Magazine, and after making hundreds of photographs of this scene-I put on waiters and began to walk towards the Super Dome walking through several feet of water. Suddenly I walked into a hole in the pavement I could not see and fell into the water drowning all of my cameras in water. I was horrified when I discovered that my cameras would not turn on and when I went to my car and tried to upload the memory cards to my laptop without success.

There is a well kept secret-Paris in August when half of the city leaves on vacation-is magnificent. There is an atmosphere that is calm, light, and when Parisians that have not left get together-there is a joy and moments of soft warmth of a feeling of having the city all to oneself. 

Last night I spent an evening on a terrace with lovely conversation and friendship. A few small themes like love, existence, being thought of with care  by others, were thrown around in the middle of lots of other laughs. A delicious moment.

With love.

This afternoon, as I walked home, I came across Sarah, from Flandres, sitting in contemplation on a city bench near La Seine. 

After making this photograph, we spoke, and Sarah from Flanders in Belgium, with amazing ginger hair, told me she was just returning from a trip to the countries of Georgie and Armenia, and on her way back to Belgium she chose to stop for a weekend in Paris. 

I told Sarah that I walked daily in Paris and would send her this photograph. When I returned home, I received a note from her saying: „I love that you are creating these portraits of people in Paris, thank you for capturing these small and unexpected moments and turning them into something that will last far longer than the afternoon. „

Sometimes, a moment with a photograph, is meant to last more than an afternoon! With love.

Most mornings, I walk across the Seine on my way home to Le Marais, after morning coffee. One of the incredible things about Paris is that most every day, as one walks across the city-one comes across moments of celebration like this that simply pop out of centuries of history and architecture. 

With love.

I worked for a period of time in the early 1980’s as an assistant to Robert Doisneau. On occasion I made press prints of his negatives at his atelier in Montrouge and assisted him on several portrait sessions as well. Robert introduced me to the director of Rapho, Raymond Grosset, and it was with Rapho that I began my early professional career as a photographer in Paris starting in 1981. Robert was both a friend and a mentor, and one of the most wonderful people I’ve ever known-a great photographer and a truly kind, generous, and amazing person. 

In 1983, Robert wrote this preface to my book, „Parisians“ which was published in 2000 and is now of print. 

He also once wrote to me in French, „To my friend Peter, who has become completely polluted by the Parisan atmosphere-with thy friendly smile-Robert Doisneau“. 

I think Robert would have been proud of the fact that I have eventually taken French nationlity, and I hope and think he would have been proud of my new book of 50 years of photographs, „Paris-Je t’aime“ which will go on sale only on my website  the first week of September. It is a beautiful hardcover book of 320 pages, and all copies will be signed. I will soon let everyone know when it is available. 

With love.

Today, we celebrate the art of freezing time of turning fleeting moments into something eternal. Street photography taught me to find beauty in the unnoticed, rhythm in the chaos, and emotion in shadows and light.
Black and white strips away distraction, what’s left is raw, honest, and human.
To everyone who sees the world through a lens, keep chasing stories in silence, light, and motion 🤗

This is the first time I’ve dedicated a video to photography techniques, so if you have any feedback (or want to see more), let me know!“Time”It’s a strange thing. Some moments stretch endlessly; others vanish before we even realize they’ve arrived. Some come gently, giving us time to pause, to breathe, to take them in. Others rush past, daring us to catch them before they disappear.Most of the time, I have the space to get to know the strangers I photograph — to ask questions, to listen, to learn who they are. Those conversations unfold like the tide, pulling memories to the surface and leaving traces of understanding in their wake. But sometimes, life moves too fast for that.When I met a lovely young French woman named Nowlenn on the steps of the , I had to work quickly. She was in a hurry to see a show, with just five minutes to spare. But sometimes, five minutes is enough.Since we didn’t have time for long conversations, much of her mystery remained — held beneath the mighty sails above us. And because I can’t share much of her story, I decided to share something else instead: my process.For the first time, I’m breaking it down, step by step. How to find the right light, how to frame a shot, how to guide someone into a natural pose — it’s all in the video.I hope this is useful for the photographers who follow me — or for anyone who wants to feel more comfortable both behind and in front of a camera. Because it’s the small choices, here and there, that turn a passing moment into something lasting.I’m grateful to Nowlenn for her kindness — she made time for me, even when she didn’t have much to give.

There aren’t any crowds loudly cheering your name while you put on your shoes to go to work. There’s no TV interview for people quietly doing their duty. And newspapers aren’t printing photos of people who are just trying to do their best each day.

“Are you happy that you said Yes?”

Most people politely decline my offer to photograph them — but then there are the brave and exceptional few like Giada who are kind enough to say “Yes”.

I think it’s easy to say “No” when a situation arises that has the potential to push you far outside of your comfort zone. From my own experience I know how difficult it can be to trust a random stranger, especially when that person is asking you to try something completely new.

It takes a lot of courage to meet that challenge head-on, and an enormous amount of heart to succeed.

Music: Ballerina by Yehezkel Raz

Puk had such resounding kindness in her voice, such effervescent energy in her hair, such deep sincerity in her eyes, and she was one of the few people who I have met to wear braces as an adult. I also wore braces as an adult (which is why I am such a smiley person now) so I know how self-conscious they can make you feel while wearing them. But she had bravery beyond measure to step in front of my camera (I don’t think I would have been brave enough to step in front of the camera of a stranger when I wore braces) and a beautiful soul to match, too. I’m so grateful that Puk allowed me to photograph both her and her lovely smile.

A few years ago I was introduced to  by @amanda.renshaw and @joel_meyerowitz (thank you both 🙏🏼)

Laurence King commissioned writer @gemmapadley and me to put together a teaching/tutorial guide about the thinking and thought process of a “street photographer”.

After many walks and talks on the street with brilliant and patient Gemma we chiseled my words and pictures together to make this book, which covers ideas and thoughts on how to stay positive, the best ways to work with the great unknown, being “good” on the street and adopting the right attitude amongst other things.

This certainly isn’t a rule book, it is just my ideas about something that I have practiced obsessively and have loved doing for over 25 years and the best ways I’ve found to keep at it.

Mentalist and street photographer @derrenbrown wrote a magical introduction and the book has been published in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and German.

It is stuffed with almost a hundred of my photos from London, America, Spain, Singapore and Gibraltar amongst other places.

The book will be available from 11th March 2021 and I hope it helps to answer some questions about something that is difficult, but a positive way of life, and certainly something that keeps you physically and mentally fit!

Hope you like it 😊",6667,467,thinklikeastreetphotographer | LaurenceKingPublishing | photobookjousting

Apart from Mimi being a great all round person the project looks really interesting. Mimi explains :

“Moon City is a photographic project exploring the silent dialogue and underlying tension between two forces at play — the ancient pull of the Moon and the restless ambition of London’s financial skyline — a quiet meditation on nature, capitalism, and the spaces in between.

I created Moon City driven by a deep sense of urgency — the same urgency that shadows our lives today. Climate change, political upheaval, social unrest, and collective traumas that, instead of bringing us closer, often push us further apart, isolating each of us in our own fragile bubble. Through this work, I hope to offer a space to pause, to look up, and to reflect — a quiet reminder of forces greater than ourselves, and of the perspectives we risk losing in the noise of modern life.”

After so much love towards my previous Romantics Preset (now the Marigold), I’ve been slowly working behind the scenes building and refining this full set to cover all kinds of moods. That’s how this new preset pack came to life 🎨

It contains five presets: Marigold, Cerulean, Noire, Nocturne and Viridian. Each one has its own mood and vibe. Whether it’s golden hour, a foggy morning, a cold winter street or one of those quiet night walks, there’s something in here for it 🌇🌃

It now also comes with an 11-page tips guide on how to get the best results, a full installation guide for Lightroom Mobile and Desktop and free updates if I ever improve or expand the pack 📸

That’s one reason of many why I’ll be returning to Belgrade and Serbia soon 🙏

The way they look, the way they feel in your hands, it reminds you why you fell in love with photography in the first place. Those retro dials and look definitely play a big part in that 📷

These days, whenever someone asks me what camera to get, especially for a beginner, I almost always recommend Fujifilm and this X-T20 in particular. It teaches you the manual stuff in a really hands-on way and the film simulations give you such good colours straight out of camera 😍

I’ve been capturing moments for years, but this era feels different. There’s a strange stillness in the air, like the world is holding its breath. Smiles feel borrowed, eyes carry weight and even silence seems louder now. It’s not the fear of what’s coming, it’s the heaviness of what already is. And sometimes I think, if someone truly stopped and asked this generation, ‘What’s wrong?’ the answer wouldn’t be words, it would be a quiet, aching scream. We’re not just tired we’re silently breaking, piece by piece. And no one really sees it.",1236,19,

This series provides a space for artists to share their newest explorations, offering a deeper look into their evolving practices beyond social media.

The inaugural show launches March 21st at Matcha Lounge, in collaboration with Temple Gallery, and features founders, @cisconyc and @jaaphotos .

📍 Matcha Lounge, NYC
Opening: March 21st | 6PM-9PM
On View: March 21st – April 4th

Featuring:
Francisco Vasquez – “No soy de aquí, ni soy de allá” explores migration, identity, and the in-between spaces of belonging.

Jean-Andre Antoine – “Whose News” captures fleeting headlines and vanishing print, reflecting on the tangible presence of news in daily life—a moment of stillness in a city that never stops. As digital feeds replace ink and paper, the work questions the future of print while evoking the urgency that defines modern existence.

The camera was the Leica M9 (2009) and it just had (and has) the most popping and beautiful straight-out-of-the-camera black & white JPG’s. So that’s what happened. But then cameras seem to go through phases with their owners, and the Leica M9 now invites (also) to color photos due to the unique CCD sensor in the Leica M9. We recognize it’s unique color science now that much other offerings are not like that, and the Hasselblad 907X (and Hasselblad X2D with same sensor) does the same: You see colors, and you can capture them in a color fidelity that just makes you smile.",283,8,

When the world stopped, so did my ability to shoot on the streets. During the pandemic, I had to adapt my process—so I turned inward. These diptychs, 2 images placed closely one on top of the other, are born from that time of isolation. They are a reflection of duality: inside and out, presence and absence, connection and distance. 

Photography has always been about moments, but in those months, it became about creating new ones when the world felt paused. These images are my way of merging two perspectives into one frame, capturing the contrast and harmony of a time when everything felt uncertain.

When ABC reconnected with his former colleague Junyang Pow at Junyang's exhibition earlier this year, it wasn’t just a catch-up. The show, quietly powerful and staged with great heart as Junyang faced his final chapter, was his way of putting one last wish into the world: to lift up young creatives. That moment stuck with ABC. Deeply moved, he made a promise to help carry Junyang’s vision forward. Singkarpor TKQ is the result, a cheeky, layered collage packed with ABC’s signature energy, and dotted with “easter eggs”: visual motifs that both artists had explored in their work, from local icons to everyday oddities.

Today, I’m proud to present Eduardo Ortiz, @eortizfoto, a Chilean photographer whose work captures the quiet, often overlooked poetry of everyday life. Eduardo approaches photography with a sense of curiosity and humility, finding beauty in simplicity and moments that others might pass by without a second glance.

His images reveal a sensitivity to the contrasts and subtle ironies of the world around him. From mundane spaces to fleeting interactions, Eduardo’s work has a grounded, almost meditative quality that reflects his own journey from the kitchen to the streets. There’s no grand ambition in his photos, just an honest attempt to make sense of his surroundings, one frame at a time. In Eduardo’s lens, every scene holds potential—whether it’s a reminder of the beauty in the ordinary or an invitation to see the familiar in a new way.

Through his photography, Eduardo invites us to pause, look closely, and appreciate the quiet stories unfolding around us.

Eduardo Ortiz @eortizfoto 

Born in Los Angeles and raised in Valparaíso, Chile, Eduardo Ortiz is a globally celebrated street and travel photographer, educator, and nomadic explorer. Originally trained in classical guitar, he transitioned into visual storytelling and has since traveled through South America, Europe, and Asia, documenting everyday life. Known for his vibrant, layered compositions and deeply observational style, Eduardo is also a Pro Member of The Raw Society and author of Understanding Colour, a zine exploring colour theory in photography, in which he deconstructs approaches to colour harmony, cinematic composition, and visual rhythm. Eduardo regularly teaches in-person workshops across the world, and shares insights on visual storytelling on YouTube and Substack.

In this talk, Eduardo explores how Gestalt theory can transform the way we understand and apply composition in photography. Through principles like figure-ground, proximity, and closure, he reveals how our perception shapes what we see—and what we create.

On the face of it, there are costs, and I don’t sell enough prints to really justify the costs. But that is more a symptom than a cause. The real issue is that selling prints is inherently looking to the past. Selling prints requires curation, and curation inevitably leads to spending my time in front of a PC instead of shooting.

Of course, curation of one’s own work is necessary (now this is something that AI would be useful for), but rather than the past I prefer to look to the future—to the next image. So that’s the true reason I’m closing my print shop. I don’t really enjoy trying to promote work that is long done, receding gently into that past. And without promotion, the shop languishes.

But anyway, this is not to say I need pity or something. Another reason I don’t have time to push my prints is that I often have new projects on the horizon. And again, with a forward-looking bias, I focus my energies on new challenges. So, I remind you that my print shop is closing on July 1st. If you’d like a print this is your last chance!

I got some interesting answers. It was about 50/50, some enjoying it, and some finding it uninteresting. I don’t take personally that people were bored by the post. I love my image, but I get that it’s not for everyone.

It just shows that even when we are very proud of something we create, it doesn’t mean it will find its audience, or that it even has an audience at all. Part of the problem is that I posted an image that is best suited for a very large format onto a medium that is consumed on tiny screens. As well.

I guess I’m at a loss, because I want to share my work in the most authentic way possible, but by doing that I’m alienating my audience. It’s a bit of a conundrum. Several people told me they prefer my street photography. But my rooftop shots are just as much a part of my vision as my street work. To me, it is all one work, one document about a city that I love.

Maybe I just need to accept obscurity. I came from obscurity, and so I can return to it. I suppose I need to make peace with this. It is something I struggle with.

On Monday, we had the first full moon of the new year 2025, and I wish you all many beautiful moments in the year ahead.

The photo ""Full Moon Bird"" was taken at the end of 2024 in Valladolid, Spain. For two months, I observed the life cycle of storks, which—amazingly—reside in this city even during the winter. These beautiful birds would leave the city during the day in search of food and return at sunset, always following the same route.
By closely observing the storks’ daily rituals, the place and timing of their journeys, and the phases of the moon, I was able to capture this moment.

I took this photograph while participating in the Creart 3.0 residency program, to which I was invited as a representative of my hometown, Lublin.

World Photography Day is celebrated on August 19th, marking the day in 1839 when the French government announced the invention of the daguerreotype and gifted it to the world as “free for humanity.” A symbolic birthday of photography.

The picture ""Humanity/Digitality - Sunset in Santorini"" is a reflection on our perception of the world and the beauty of nature. The photograph eloquently illustrates man's attitude towards the progressive technologization and digitization of life. The frame was captured on the Greek 🇬🇷 island of Santorini, known for its white-blue houses hanging on cliffs and the most beautiful sunsets. It was inspired by the crowd of tourists observing this phenomenon through cameras, telephones, taking selfies. Nobody contemplated directly the beauty of this fleeting moment. Sunsets are one of the most frequently photographed phenomena, which later dominate the pictures placed on social networking sites, such as Instagram or Facebook.

photo: „Hiroshima - Phoenix Rising from the Ashes”.

The photo’s reference is the place where it was taken: the city of Hiroshima. Now one of humanity’s most prominent sites, during WWII razed to the ground by the most powerful weapon mankind has ever invented and used. Dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima killed well over 100,000 people and crippled many more.

The city, just like the mythical bird phoenix – a representation of eternal rebirth – rose from the ashes and became a symbol of memory, peace and mercy.

The photo symbolically refers to the story of a girl named Sadako Sasaki who survived the bombing of Hiroshima, but became very seriously ill as a result of radiation. Sadako started making 1,000 origami cranes, referring to a Japanese legend, she believed that it would heal her. Unfortunately, she made 644 cranes and passed away, but the rest of the cranes were made by children from her class and Sadako had been buried with 1000 origami cranes. Sadako and cranes have become symbols of world peace in Japan. Now the children leave thousands of cranes at the Sadako monument in Hiroshima.

ℹ️ En su serie de fotografías, Marcin Ryczek (Lublin, Polonia, 1982) explora el poder de los símbolos, su significado cultural y su influencia en la percepción de la realidad en diferentes contextos. Las fotografías, aunque minimalistas, son portadoras de una narrativa multidimensional en la que las composiciones geométricas, los contrastes de color y la disposición natural de los elementos remiten a ideas universales: identidad, equilibrio, límites, transitoriedad, relaciones entre el ser humano y la naturaleza, o tradición y modernidad.

Las fotografías hacen referencia a símbolos conocidos, como las banderas nacionales, pero también a otras referencias metafóricas, ya se inspiren en gráficos y formas geométricas o en ideas filosóficas. De hecho, las interpretaciones de este trabajo pueden fluir desde un sentimiento de esperanza y cercanía a la naturaleza hasta una reflexión profunda sobre la soledad y la fugacidad del tiempo.

Waiting outside a buffet resto, our subject strives to be the most succulent dish.

As one surveying the streets while alert and invisible, I’m granted access to such intimate moments; witnessing strangers’ truest visages and virtues when no one of note is watching. 

Often this puts duplicity on display: false joy dissolving on the unseen side of a hug, eyes rolling when backs are turned. Sometimes, it’s the opposite – people playing it cool face-the-face, then beaming while walking away.

Very often, it’s the vanity, insecurity, loneliness felt by all but hidden by most. I know my camera would capture it often were it pointed in the other direction.

This striking soul has assembled an ensemble intended to dazzle under the guise of an effortless outfit. From ink/makeup/nails to awesome accessories to the meticulous arrangement of each strand of hair and denim, they’re perfectly projecting their preferred identity (which includes being too cool to care).

Before their acquaintance arrives, they’ll hide the phone and assume a casual, distracted demeanor. When complimented on the look, they’ll act surprised – “oh, I just threw something on.”

Don’t worry, I’ll never tell.
Undoubtedly, your companion will eat it up…then come back for seconds.",167,7,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DNyjLGOZKVn/,midlifeinparis,2025-08-25,img1,"“The Coneheads” / 2025.08.25

Heatwaves have passed and été’s end is in sight, but there’s never a bad time for iced cream!

The Marais is wonderful for finding street food but a terrible place to consume it. Falafel purveyors, kosher delicatessens, and artisanal vendors of glace line these narrow cobblestone streets but supply hardly a place to sit.

That’s why one encounters so many visitors awkwardly walking and eating – sandwiches juggled, pita’s erupting, melting cones glazing hands of all ages. Some try making it to a nearby park, battling heat and temptation…others lean against posts or precipitously perch posteriors on unaccommodating ledges and curbs. 

This family ducked down a quiet side street to recline against the wall, sacrificing the quartier’s picturesque surroundings to peacefully gobble gelato. They’re like unusual suspects in a very leisurely police lineup, or firing squad victims granted a final request -- who needs a blindfold or gross cigarette when you can savor a cornet of bliss?",265,16,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DNtgLxLZO11/,midlifeinparis,2025-08-23,img1,"“La Favorite” / 2025.08.23

What lithe through yonder window breaks...?

Visiting influencers compose glamorous scenes of gorgeous models framed by breathtaking views shot outward through perfectly placed fenêtres. Conversely, I find the city’s most evocative shots capture classic quotidian moments…like locals convening at the café.

This photo is both, and neither.

It isn’t staged, but -- like so many Parisian moments -- feels nearly too perfect to be true; a (sur)real slice of life. Several stories unfold in one charming spot, converging if not intersecting. The players are generally oblivious to each other while we observe them all, privy to the city’s enchantment spanning several levels – literally and figuratively.",355,9,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DNoSGWlSJoc/,midlifeinparis,2025-08-21,img1,"“Aye, Contact” / 2025.08.21

Like any modern major metropolis, Paris has suffering citizens on its streets. 

From lost souls with mental health challenges who the system has forsaken to recognizable quartier characters who become part of the community, to organized crews carpooled to corners where they pluck heartstrings for hard currency…these rues can become a gauntlet spawning guilt, compassion, and frustration.

Most wish to help but feel handcuffed handing out cigarettes and centiemes, especially as high demand quickly empties limited packs and pockets. When resources are scarce, we hope human gestures supply dignity in lieu of sustenance; sharing a smile, a sentence, eye contact to dissolve invisible divisions.

Unfortunately, the evident delta between what’s needed and given can make the air awkward on all sides. Shame for asking. Shame for denying. Unwanted pity and unwarranted embarrassment drive retreat instead of connection…all communicated instantly when empathetic souls intersect. 

It starts with a glance – or avoidance thereof – between yeux across a chasm: an emotional opera conducted without words, perhaps captured in that silent split second.",207,9,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DNgleovSrrI/,midlifeinparis,2025-08-18,img1,"“Confronting Mortality” / 2025.08.18

Place Igor Stravinsky is an anomalous square with a whimsical fountain bounded by a medieval church, world-famous museum, row of terraced cafés, and an adorned industrial façade. 

Adding a tiny tourist in cowgirl princess attire nudges the scene towards surreal. Especially when that young Texas pageant escapee fearlessly stares down death while seemingly prepared to dance on water.

Perhaps she fancies herself as Arya Stark, whose water-dancing instructor taught her to also defy mortality.

""What do we say to the god of death?”
“Not today.”

Syrio Forel would be proud of her stance.
Salvador Dalí would embrace the tableau.
I hope you like it too.",193,14,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DNbfrXgSn4t/,midlifeinparis,2025-08-16,img1,"""Sous le Louvre"" / 2025.08.16

Common sense dictates that when a canicule strikes, one should seek the cool temps of cavern.

Here in a passage beneath the Palais de Louvre, a focused performer and passing pedestrians seem denizens of divergent planes...yet tacit transactions trading music for currency weave a connection enhancing both worlds.

It’s a building renowned for glorious galleries and breathtaking objets d’art, where even in the darker architectural recesses one discovers impromptu virtuosity.",245,12,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DNTp5NwycSz/,midlifeinparis,2025-08-13,img1,"""Bashful"" / 2025.08.13

Anyone wandering Parisians streets is accustomed to displays of affection - big smiles and bisous are witnessed wherever friends rendezvous.

Deep lip locks that last for minutes with hungry hands subtly pulling hips tighter are less common (though far from rare in this romantic air).

Still, some are shocked by the passion. 

This sandstone sculpture is known as l'Écoute, for its hand cupped to the ear for listening...yet from this angle, it appears the blushing boulder is shielding its eyes from shame.

After staring all day at the chaste sanctity of Église Saint-Eustache, it's no wonder he's a little surprised by this demonstration of deep amour. Perhaps our big friend should be less prude, lower his hand, and ask Lady Liberty out on a date.",292,33,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DNOdf_7h4SB/,midlifeinparis,2025-08-11,img1,"""Taste of Seattle"" / 2025.08.11

When suburban ados hop a train to Paris, it's often to sample overseas cultures. Lebanese ice cream, second-hand Levi's, manga comics, and international cinema all merit attention...but no trip is complete without Starbucks.

In a nation famous for café culture, the brand's local allure escapes me...but whenever I duck in for a venti hit of home, the place is packed with giggling teens.

For this young couple, the visit appears part of a themed itinerary: paired with grunge/Goth vibes and a Nirvana shirt, they’ve planned a full Seattle sejour. 

Alas, the elements of their emerald reverie are both cogent and contradictory. While Kurt and the mermaid share a hometown and could each be labeled Sirens, juxtaposing the visages of a renowned anti-capitalist with a notorious corporate logo undermines the frontman’s message.

At least it appears that neither party is enjoying their American delicacy. Perhaps rejecting donuts and cake pops is their way of honoring Cobain’s legacy…I would have suggested a couple of cups of Pennyroyal Tea.",252,32,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DNGxk3rSGzX/,midlifeinparis,2025-08-08,img1,"“Shakespeare’s Company” / 2025.08.08

Bookshops are scarcer but have lost none of their magic, as evidenced on the banks of the Seine.

Shakespeare & Co. is a legendary libraire found in the heart of the city. Its amazing location, enchanting environment, and celebrated pedigree make it a Mecca for lovers of words. Bibliophiles, Anglophones, tourists, historians and more flock to this cottage, imbuing the quaint shoppe with a heavy hushed buzz usually reserved for the hallowed.

Amongst all these pilgrims, one stalwart stood out.

One recent spring, this fashionable madame was often found out front with her chien. Casually oblivious to the surrounding circus, she calmly sat – sometimes napped – in the eye of the literary storm. Her distinct presence supplued additional character to an already colorful scene. At regular intervals, she’d visit the Wallace Fountain, always filling a cup for her pup.

Is she an author, a lingering phantom, perhaps one of Hemingway’s mistresses patiently awaiting his return? With 10,000 volumes lining these walls, hers may be the best story of all.",383,24,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DNBrMk_yJaF/,midlifeinparis,2025-08-06,img1,"“Nature Morte” / 2025.08.06

Exploring the Louvre’s endless galleries is enough to utterly exhaust. Sizzling beneath Paris’ summer sun tends to do the same. Both ordeals in one afternoon can clearly leave one (or two) dead tired.

Securing shade in the famous Cour Napoléon is no simple task; wide open spaces with rays bouncing off pyramids and pools leave tourists baking on bleached stone like lizards. Café Marly’s coveted, covered tables (seen on the balcony above) present an excellent option for respite and refreshment…but require a little luck and a lot of Euros.

Plan B is seeking some corner where columns cast shadows, sleeping hidden from the brutal soleil. Or perhaps our pair are reenacting works witnessed within the museum's wings.

Frazzled and lifeless, our subjects resemble Medusa stragglers clinging to Géricault’s raft…or perhaps their prostrate poses reflect Caravaggio’s Death of the Virgin.

This image may not be a wall-worthy masterpiece, but is certainly a fun slice of “still life”.",464,26,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DM8n7AGyuTI/,midlifeinparis,2025-08-04,img1,"“Island Intimacy” / 2025.08.04

On this overcast afternoon, a young couple finds isolation in the middle of a bustling city; the rest of Paris now worlds away from their private perch on the Seine. 

Time stands still even as the river gently flows around romantic Île Saint-Louis – lovers’ eyes locked nearly as tightly as the grasp of her leather-bound legs.

Huddled together with limbs interwoven like vines, displaying static beauty and beating hearts, raging hunger and rooted patience, their connection spans multiple kingdoms. More than primates – or even prime mates -- they are both flora and fauna en l’ile.",242,9,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DM0pp7hsroM/,midlifeinparis,2025-08-01,img1,"“Considering History” / 2025.08.01

Clouds, contrails, and comfortable camaraderie round out a classic scene in the Luxembourg Garden.

Though these copines are commoners, they present a noble air while pondering an edifice that’s progressed from palace to prison to parliament. Mimicking its erratic history, the jardins foster an atmosphere simultaneously austere and light-hearted.

Are the young women condemning vainglorious colonizers who constructed such a castle or contemplating how one day they might be senators within?

Such is the bright side of a fluid society: the capacity for somber reflection and soaring aspiration.",294,25,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DMvYZtTp7_O/,midlifeinparis,2025-07-30,img1,"“Waiting with Gauloises” / 2025.07.30

Time for a new entry among our subcategory of shots that could serve as the subjects’ album cover.

An eye-catching duo make a meal of their smokes and strike subconscious poses on stairs in the heart of Les Halles. Staking a seat where two market streets meet is perfect for people watching…and being watched by people.

Methinks they like both sides of that framing. 

If they are a music group, what is the band name and the title of this glorious album?

Answer below – no wrong guesses (but please don’t be mean), only creative fun…",156,12,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DMqeVBwST1w/,midlifeinparis,2025-07-28,img1,"“Determination” / 2025.07.28

Girding oneself to wade into the workweek takes the steely resolve of old madams navigating a market. Though appearing diminutive, elderly, or frail, one should never overlook their tenacity. Give them respect -- and a wide enough berth – lest you become underfoot fodder.

Bon courage for the week – may you set a steady gaze and proceed towards your goal despite any obstacles or oafs in your path.",150,7,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DMivnc_SF-0/,midlifeinparis,2025-07-25,img1,"“White Horse, Brown Bear, Grey Man” / 2025.07.25

Another set of street sentinels – one senior and one stuffed – sit astride a passageway beside Place de la Bastille.

It’s unclear whether they’re guardians, bouncers, or storied sphinxes poised to pose a riddle… but they’re certainly striking while stoically seated beneath a searing sun.

Do they await a white horse or rue the fact that one has already bolted? 
Are they conversing or awkwardly silent, a showdown between rivals?

Frozen moments rarely supply simple, succinct answers. More often they’re mysteries -- curious enigmas forever preserved in pixels rather than amber; teasing the brain, provoking thoughts…and, hopefully, evoking a smile.",186,13,

Have you ever thought your photos could become a limited edition book? This photographer made it! And he did it by entering our international street and documentary photography contest.

Jonathan Jasberg @seat1aflyer , winner of Eyeshot Open Call 2022, shows us a different kind of beauty—through the lens of street photography.

In his photography collection ”Cairo: A Beautiful Thing Is Never Perfect”, Jasberg captured a raw, layered, and honest portrait of Cairo. These are everyday moments turned extraordinary, shaped by light, shadow, and the rhythm of real life.

Forget the clichés. This is real street photography. Follow us and support independent street photography by entering Eyeshot Open Call 2025: there’s only 3 days left!

Lasciati guidare dalla luce in tutte le sue forme, dalle prime ombre dell’alba ai riflessi del tardo pomeriggio, e permetti che illumini la tua visione, modellando contrasti e atmosfere. Crea poi un dialogo autentico con i tuoi soggetti: avvicinati con rispetto, osserva le regole non scritte della strada e scopri come l’empatia possa aprire porte invisibili a chi non sa ascoltare.

Il 4 e 5 ottobre 2025, con Eolo Perfido, Napoli diventerà il tuo laboratorio a cielo aperto: due giorni di pratica sul campo e revisione guidata per affinare tecnica e voce narrativa.

Insieme a Eolo Perfido imparerai a cogliere la trama nascosta dietro ogni gesto, a danzare con l’imprevisto che anima i vicoli di Napoli, a trasformare il frastuono urbano in silenzio visivo dove la tua voce si definisce con chiarezza.

Per due giorni Napoli diventerà un laboratorio a cielo aperto. Grazie alla guida di Eolo, scoprirai come ogni incrocio possa diventare un teatro di relazioni e come la Q3, discreta e precisa, ti permetta di svelarne l’essenza senza interromperne il ritmo.

A fine giornata, rivedrai i tuoi scatti insieme a Eolo, affinando ritmo e coerenza narrativa: un confronto essenziale per trasformare frammenti apparentemente casuali in un racconto compiuto.

Se cerchi un’esperienza capace di accendere lo sguardo e affinare la tua presenza in strada, Napoli è il palcoscenico ideale e questo workshop la chiave per attraversarlo con autenticità.

La città, fatta di neon luccicanti e templi antichi, diventerà il tuo set a cielo aperto: un luogo dove ogni angolo offre spunti per la street photography.

Il workshop unisce l’esperienza di due fotografi di fama internazionale, garantendoti approcci e stili differenti. Per Eolo, Hong Kong è «un paradiso» di contrasti visivi; per Stefano, è lo scenario ideale in cui ritmo e relazioni si intrecciano andando oltre lo scatto “facile”.

Lavorare con entrambi ti permetterà di esplorare la fotografia di strada da prospettive complementari e di arricchire il tuo modo di osservare e raccontare la città.

Un ritratto è molto più della semplice rappresentazione di un volto: è l'arte di cogliere uno sguardo capace di rivelare l’intreccio di esperienze, desideri e fragilità del soggetto fotografato. È lì che nasce la narrazione, ed è lì che si riconosce la mano di un autore.

Partecipare al workshop di due giorni ""Ritratto Contemporaneo"" con Eolo Perfido offre un'opportunità unica di apprendere da uno dei migliori ritrattisti contemporanei, i cui lavori sono stati pubblicati su prestigiose testate come il Ny Times, Vision, Vogue Russia, GQ, L'Espresso.

Absolutely thrilled to be on the cover this time too! Woo hoo! Inside is a photo essay of some of my images from the “Through the Glass” series that so many of you have spoken to me about over the years. I started taking these back in 2018 and I continue to add to the project to this day. For this particular essay I decided to use some images that I made with the X-T1 in 2019 and in the UK to demonstrate how accessible street photography can be. This model is now ten years old and can be picked up for a very reasonable price. Plus, most of what I learnt in the early days was in my local town of Exeter. There tends to be a lot of noise generated around the latest gear and travel but I wanted to put a reminder out there that you don’t have to spend much or go very far to get started. 

**WORKSHOP** To coincide with this feature I have teamed up with @stephaniebaxter.co at Fuji Academy to teach an online workshop called Through the Glass: An introduction to shooting candid portraits.
During the workshop I will guide you through my processes, tips on what to look out for and how to deal with reflections. 

How to enhance your images with glass including framing, texture, layering, light and contrast. 

How to overcome your fears when photographing strangers

I also want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all those featured for being incredibly gracious with being photographed and giving their consent. It never fails to amaze me how many wonderful people I meet during my outings with my camera. 

I have to say, as a photographer, the best part about being asked to be involved in a campaign like this was being one of the very first people to get my hands on and test run this brand new beautiful little camera, what a privilege. And then watching the speculation about the product grow as the launch date neared was so much fun. I’m proud to say I remained tight lipped until the day!

And to all of you who I’ve seen or met over these last few months at either a launch, presentation, festival, workshop - It’s been a blast. What an incredibly lovely and supportive community we have, I doubt there are many better. Cheers to you 🥂📷

And for those asking.. yes I’ve ordered the X-E5 and can’t wait to be reunited with the little chap. 💋

Curated by Francis Hodgson (@hodgsonf), London Lives reflects London in its complexity — its streets and structures, its history and reinvention, its rhythm and resilience.

Nick Turpin (@the_nick_turpin) is an internationally renowned Street Photographer who started his career with The Independent Newspaper in London at the age of 20. In 2000 Nick founded the influential in-public Street Photographers group that played a significant role in the contemporary resurgence of interest in the approach. Nick’s series of London commuters ‘On The Night Bus’ was published to much acclaim in 2017. Nick is known as an observer and commentator on the Street Photography scene and is invited to talk about the genre as much as he is his own work.

Vitor Damásio here with some news!
We are leaving IHSP.

It’s been 5 years since IHSP was founded and it’s been wonderful to have had the chance to curate such amazing photos and be part of the community.

We made podcasts, met people, talked, told jokes, but most important, we showed a lot of good work.

As many of you know, IHSP never had the idea of doing competitions or take anyones money, but show people, no matter how many followers they had.
 The gallery will be here, we will not delete or sell the account, as a form of archive.

To everyone who I’ve promised takeovers or posts, hope you understand that everything comes to an end.

Thank you!

https://www.instagram.com/p/C5Wl4PbydVg/,ferriswhiskey,2024-04-04,img1,"Last year I had the honour of winning the ‘Australian Life’ photography prize, organised by the wonderful people @cityofsydney. This year I’ve once again joined the judging panel and I would strongly encourage everyone I know who is eligible to enter. It’s free to enter, finalists have their images displayed in large-format light boxes in one if the most prominent settings in Sydney, and the grand prize is $10,000. All pictures are viewed and judged anonymously and given careful consideration. It really is one of Australia’s best and most accessible competitions for photographers. Get your entries in before April 21st.

.
In the weeks leading up to the 2024 election, I hurled myself into New York like whiskey down a dry throat, chasing the manic heartbeat of a city that refused to slow down. The whole place felt charged with energy, on the verge of something, and everywhere I turned I found spectacle. Trump loyalists descended on Madison Square Garden, protesters penned behind a wall of police screaming themselves hoarse. Across the river, cyclists at Bike Kill tore through Brooklyn in an anarchic parade of freedom, joy, and danger. The Village turned out for Halloween night with prophets and demons flooding the streets, while Midtown seethed with comic book gladiators and cosplayers as convincing as any candidate. It was democracy as theatre, chaos as ritual, the city vibrating with tension and glee, defiance and exhaustion. The photographs came fast and feverish, fragments torn from a landscape too surreal to trust to memory. As an outsider, I felt both seduced and overwhelmed, caught between the noise and the stubborn spark of resilience that kept flaring through the cracks. These images are not answers but fragments, a record of a city staggering forward on adrenaline and dread, hungry to preserve, reinvent, and be.",181,26,nycspc | streetphotography | nyc

Been meaning to do this for a while…
I’m back running regular group photo walks in London — small groups (6 max), and a mix of popular + lesser-known fav spots I’ve shot for years.

These events are aimed at beginners, amateur enthusiasts, London visitors or anyone who wants to explore the city through a camera or phone, shoot street photography in a group or pick my brains for photography tips along the way. Private walks are also available.

📍 London locations (Central and Shoreditch)

📅 Aug + Sept dates now live (more to come!) Weekends & midweek events

🎟️ Use EARLYBIRDAUG15 for 15% off any August walks — ends 11th August

“I have a huge hatred for AI. As a graphic designer and a photographer, AI has weaseled its way into both fields. Many ads that I see about AI and photography showcase people taking strangers walking behind them out of a family portrait, or abstracting the skies to showcase a more beautiful sunset. Both of which abstracts the reality, taking the image to an entirely generated space. Personally, I dislike this greatly, as I find beauty in showing the reality. I want to take photos to capture moments in their true form, rather than altered to abstract reality.

“And film photography has more permanence to me than digital photography; I love the tangibility of it. With film, you’re utilizing physical light to expose an image onto film, to then develop into a photograph. Digital photography, at the end of the day is a file on your camera that’s then moved to your computer screen; it feels less personal. Often times, with digital photographs, you can manipulate them to become whatever your mind envisions. With film photography, there can be many more risks, and many more mistakes. I love the ‘mistakes’ made with shooting film, it gives my images a character to them, some more significance that can’t necessarily be edited away.” @emuhs

Michael:

“When it comes to AI and photography, I am vehemently against it. For the most part, I do not like the idea of algorithms creating soulless images instead of art created by a person with a soul. In the best images, the photographer’s soul/presence can be felt.

“With the exponential growth of technology in my lifespan and those younger than me, there is a natural reaction to slow down and distance
oneself from all the stimulation that is ever present in today’s world. The growth of analog media, from vinyl coming back to the use of cassettes now growing, is a natural reaction to the crazy advancements in technology we have grown to accept as normal. Film photography is right there too in the desire to slow down in a fast paced world.” @light.reid

First of all, it’s hard to call something unique when it used to literally be the way of life for all photographers until just a couple decades ago. But beyond that, I shoot on film because there’s something special to it beyond a yearning for the past. People don’t use oil lamps anymore, and for good reason. And they have rightfully switched to mobile phones because landlines are impractical. Film, on the other hand, will never be shaken out by the digital world. It is timeless and will always hold its value in the same way that painting or sculpting will.

“Yes, it’s far more expensive than digital, but taking countless photos of the same subject on a SIM card slowly diminishes the heart of what was trying to be captured in the first place. The shot may look more professional on digital, but that same ‘lottery ticket’ feeling you get from film will never exist. I think what draws me most to film is the physicality of it. There’s no computation, code, or cloud to save things on. Whichever way the light imprints onto the stock is what I get. A side effect of this attribute is that I may sometimes lose a memory in its tangible form. Whether I let a little too much sunlight creep in, or the camera gets too hot, an entire roll of film can be destroyed the same way a canvas can be accidentally ripped. Even though I know it’s still a mechanical device, capturing moments of my loved ones or extraordinary scenery feels like I’m doing material work that can be cherished. Like someone spinning clay to build a bowl. I feel like I’m creating and protecting something at the same time. To me, there’s something really special in that.” @benjbissen

So it’s no surprise that film photography is something that speaks to me.

“My real reintroduction to film happened six years ago, while helping my mom pack up my childhood home. Tucked away in a drawer, long untouched, I found my dad’s old Yashica Electro 35. He isn’t here anymore, and there are very few tangible pieces of him left in my life, so discovering that camera felt like a treasure he’d left for me to find one day. 

“At first, I was intimidated by it and afraid to use it wrong, so it sat on a shelf for a couple of years. But eventually, I picked up a roll of Ilford black and white film, loaded the Yashica, and started shooting. I haven’t stopped since. 

“There’s something ceremonious about shooting film. It demands presence. Intention. I don’t casually fire off endless frames and scroll through them afterward. I compose. I trust. And in that trust, I’ve found a way to loosen the grip of perfectionism. I make space for flaws, for accidents, for a little magic. I’ve come to believe that not knowing exactly how something will turn out is one of the most beautiful parts of both film, and life.” @the.dandydame

“I took up film photography as a regular hobby about two years ago. I’m a graphic designer and illustrator, so I wanted to use film photography as a way of escape from my computer and all these digital gears that surround me day after day. 

“Nowadays, I don’t think there’s any technical excuse to use film instead of digital, but I would say the main reason I prefer film is because it’s more fun! The fact that I don’t have a screen to see what I just shot, or any chance to correct a pose or framing, gives me more time to appreciate ‘real-life’ moments. Then there’s the physical sound of the camera and of course, the excitement to see the results from the film lab. 

“In Street Film Photography, sometimes I shoot and I think I captured that unique moment, but the truth is that I missed it by half a second. Sometimes, I see something special and shoot even without looking at the optic because of the hurry, and it ends up being a great photo. That, I think is the beauty behind film photography, the beauty of the unexpected. 

“My Yashica T4 has a 35mm Carl Zeiss lens, which is amazingly sharp and the main reason why I use this specific compact. It’s great for direct flash photos! For film, I mostly use Kodak Portra 400, but I also like Kodak Gold 200 in the summer.” @mor8

I was looking for something that could document everyday memories and allow me to express my creativity at the same
time. To be honest, I chose film because I didn’t want to invest in a DSLR immediately, and I thought film would be a great way to test the water. 

“It was frustrating at first - constantly trying to figure out the mechanics and how to expose properly, without being able to view the result right away and improve on the spot, which adds another layer of challenge. It’s truly something can only be mastered through trial and error.However, shooting film has taught me that trusting the process is really all you can do. There’s no room for the critical voices to emerge and take over immediately. To achieve the best result, you just have to apply your knowledge to the best of your ability, focus on the moment, and capture your vision as is. It taught me how to be more deliberate with my shots and slowly take in whatever I’m trying to photograph. Another thing I love about film photography is the variety of unique effects you can achieve, which are hard to replicate with a digital camera, such as organic grains, red halation, and light leaks (always ends up being a happy accident for me). The roughness and imperfection really add another layer of charm to the photos. 

“To me, the process of eagerly anticipating the film scans sort of feels like waiting to open a Christmas present - you probably won’t like 100% of what you get, but the ones that stand out will strike a chord. Overall, through film photography, I have become more intentional and aware of all the elements that bring my artistic vision to life. It will always be an endearing medium to me, no matter how much time has passed.” @byarterlioz

But now with my time away from photography coupled with technological advancements, for me, it quickly became overwhelming. There were too many menu options. The viewfinder was too busy. There were too many things to pay attention to that distracted me from the shot. Because memory card space is virtually unlimited, I would take 7-8 images of the same subjects and afterward, realized that I now have go through and edit/eliminate the 4-500 photos in between weekly trips. At this point, I realized the disconnect was between myself and the digital format.
 
“Not wanting to give up on photography this time, I decided to explore film. Being a DJ (far longer than I’ve been a photographer), I’ve always enjoyed the hands on, simple, and straightforward approach to playing records vs. using a laptop, and hoped that shooting film would provide a similar analog experience. I researched different film cameras and formats, and after a couple years of buying, selling, and trading film camera equipment, I finally settled on my current setup which includes 2 Leicaflex SLs (lenses include 35mm Elmarit, 50mm Summicron, 90mm Elmarit, 135mm Elmarit), 2 Yashica Ds (Yashikor and Yashinon versions), an Olympus Pen FT half frame (40mm G. Zuiko lens) , and an Olympus XA2. I went into shooting film knowing very little and now I roll, develop, scan, and print; handling the entire process from start to finish in-house. My images have been featured on the social media pages of several prominent organizations including MoMA, The Getty Museum, and Kodak.” @beecanshoot

I feel like film is an incredibly authentic medium to document the world, and AI is the exact opposite, so they don’t go together, and my personality doesn’t go with AI either. Even my digital images are AI-free. It’s cool to see what people can make with it, but it’s not for me. The look of analog film will always be far more beautiful than any deeply edited digital image, and knowing I can transpose light onto a tiny film scan and recreate an image in a beautiful way is just incredible. I started out with film around 2019 with a Nikon FE2 and a 35mm lens. It was my bread and butter for a long time, but decided to upgrade slightly to the Nikon F3, which I still have. It’s half broken, and totally manual at this point, but I love shooting with it, and I’ll probably keep it forever. Aside from that I use a Mamiya C330, Contax G2, and a Fuji GA645. I don’t have too much, but each one is used intentionally depending on what and where I’m shooting. 

“When I’m out shooting film, I want to capture the authentic world as accurately as I can. That’s why I love film, it’s the most pure form of photography that makes me a more intentional photographer. I love the look of it, the rawness it brings, the intensity (or lack of) grain, the dynamic range, and how it truly feels nostalgic. I feel like a lot of people who started shooting film were like myself- bored of the refined, digital look. Living in this high-tech, digitally clean age, I think people are looking to film because they’re seeing images captured in a way that makes them feel more emotion and they want a taste of it.” @jonathanhicksjr_ @heyjono

I wasn’t in love with the image it produced but I loved the way the camera felt in my hand. I started to realize after every photograph I took I would check the screen to see if I got the shot and criticize the photograph. I hated having access to the image right away, it would remove me from being present in the street. Around that time, I started working for a photographer who really enjoyed my work and he said to me one day ‘if you can do this on film you’d be the real deal.’ I sold my M9 that week to purchase a Leica M3 and started shooting film in the beginning of 2018. 

“I love the way film slows me down, makes me really think about what is going on around me. It presents me with this foundation of color and texture that digital doesn’t. My journey with film has been a love story really. The way I can experiment with different film types, over and under exposing, pushing and pulling, expired films, etc. And printing from a negative is unmatched. The cameras and lenses play a role in this for me as well. These mechanical machines from different eras accompanied by film still producing beautiful imagery is fascinating to me. 

“For the past three years the majority of my street photography has been shot on Kodak Ektachrome 100 and some expired E200 when I can get my hands on it. Color positive film or slide film is an unforgiving film that has light grain, rich shadows, high contrast, and a cool undertone. All that being said, it’s not about the film or the tools I use. It’s about the moment happening in front of me and how I capture it.” @_codycutter

In November 2020, when Honduras was hit with 2 of the most devastating hurricanes in its history, Eta and Iota, we were forced to evacuate once our home began to flood. We left with nothing but the clothes we were wearing. Thank God, we had the chance to go back before the second flood hit. We left the city with a few changes of clothes, some documents and 2 suitcases filled with photo albums. I’m now in the process of scanning literally thousands of photos/prints. It’s merely a measure to have a backup in cases like that of the flood. I don’t think digitals/scans could ever compare to the tangibility and value of all the photo album we’ve filled along the years, but it’s insurance. 

“Back when I used a digital camera, I often found myself editing until it looked close enough to film, as many do now. Film allows me to feel that my film photos, by some chemical wonder, can authentically look better than what my eye sees. We’re living in an era of remakes and bringing back old trends, scavenging for film cameras, old record players, where we’ve realized how good analog art is and are now trying to replicate it with what technology has to offer. I love the idea that creativity thrives on limitations. This really sticks with me in my day to day, but encompasses perfectly as to why there’s something so fascinating about film. Film photography may come as a challenge and it demands to be experimented with. I’m beyond certain film is not going anywhere anytime soon. I’m far from where I want to be as a photographer but it’s too fun a journey to rush it.

“Note: my Nikon F with a Nikkor-S Auto 1:1.4 50mm lens and Sunpak 555 flash, this camera my dad bought in his early 20s and handed it down to me a couple of years ago. That day we realized it was last used just about 20 years ago, after we found an unfinished roll inside.

I thought that it was out of range for me at the time, and so I got excited when I found out online about Soviet cameras. They are popular with film photographers who want to give a classic German camera a go, on a budget. It was interesting learning the history of how the Soviet union ‘took’ the plans from German camera factories after World War II. 

“It so happens that my parents are Jewish Immigrants from Ukraine, and I have ancestors who fought in WWII, so I got a FED camera with a lens, real cheap. But unfortunately, the camera body needed some repairs and there were light leaks. The Ebay seller just gave me a refund, as it probably wasn’t worth repairing. Well now I basically had this FED lens for free, so I was looking for a camera body.  Fortunately, I found the Original Leica III series cameras to be still within budget. I like the look of this camera, and I find the mechanics feel better on the Leica. My mom described the difference like this ‘the FED goes Khlop! and the Leica goes Tssk!’ 

“My family and family friends seem to recognize and get excited by the FED lens, and kinda overlook that I actually have a Leica camera. A relative who is a photographer gave the camera a try at a family Bar Mitzvah and was like ‘guys look, remember these?’ I decided eventually to give medium format a try, and got a Kiev 88, which I guess is the Soviet Hasselblad ripoff, and I’m pretty happy with it, apparently passersby’s also like it. @yoseftovshteyn

My first camera was a simple KODAK FunSaver 35mm Single Use Camera, and eventually, I also used Fujifilm QuickSnap One Time Use 35mm for variety. They’re still my go-to for that raw, unpolished look. I’ve stayed with these because I love how they capture moments exactly as they are, without any ‘perfecting’. I think that natural quality is missing in most digital shots. Film makes me more intentional with each shot. Since I can’t just click endlessly or review right away, I take more time setting up the frame and being in the moment. That extra cost also pushes me to make each shot count, and for me, it’s absolutely worth it because I get something truly unique in return.

“As for AI, I think it has its place in digital work, but with film, I prefer the imperfections. Film doesn’t give you the option to edit easily, so I find it’s easier to just accept the shot for what it is. There’s no ‘undo’ button, and I love that rawness because it feels more real.

“Film has completely changed my approach to photography in general. It’s taught me to look for the story in each frame, rather than aiming for perfection. I’ve had experiences with film that I probably wouldn’t have had with a digital camera, like meeting new people or just soaking in the scene a bit longer before I press the shutter. One time, I took a late-night shot with just ambient lighting, something I couldn’t have ‘fixed’ with digital. It ended up being one of my favorite shots because of that unique, moody vibe that only film could capture.” @puchaa

It’s less about just capturing a moment, and more about experiencing it fully. Film forces me to be present and intentional. There’s no screen to check, no instant feedback, no distractions—just you and the frame you’re composing. Digital always makes me second-guess and overshoot, but with film, I trust my instincts more. There’s a beauty in the commitment and in the imperfections that film naturally introduces. Every frame costs something, so every shot feels more deliberate. That’s part of the appeal—it makes me think, and connect more with what I’m photographing. The final images carry that weight of thought and patience. And honestly, the emotional value I get from it outweighs the financial cost.

“My main camera is a Leica MP. I love it for its sleek design and the tactile feedback—it’s a joy to use. It has beautiful custom green leather made by Leica in Wetzlar, which is just an hour away from my hometown of Frankfurt. I usually pair it with a Leica Elmarit-M 28mm f/2.8 ASPH and a Voigtländer Nokton 35mm f/1.4 VM. I have a few other cameras. One of which is a Canon FTB that I inherited from my grandfather. That camera had been with him to the corners of the world and holds deep sentimental value for me. Every time I hold it in my hands, I wonder what it has seen through its lens in its lifespan of over 50 years.” @henry_buettner

My parents and I had just immigrated to the States from Bangladesh. My mom would send photos of us back home to show her family what our new life looked like. It was one of the first things we shared and enjoyed doing together. She’d frame the shot, usually with herself in the center and I’d just click. I still remember the first time I changed the composition and placed her off-center. She didn’t agree and had me retake it the way she imagined. But about two weeks later, she came rushing to me, face lit up, holding the off-center photo I’d completely forgotten about. That day I was praised in a way I hadn’t experienced before. It was a feeling that really stuck with me. 

“Years later, when I was sixteen, we visited our ancestral villages. I remember walking into a distant relative’s house and seeing childhood photos of me and my family, images I hadn’t seen in over a decade. They were the prints my mom and I had mailed back all those years ago. Twelve years later, we were on the other side of the memory, and it was just as vivid, just as real. Moments like those are what solidified the power of photography for me.

“There’s a deep honor in being invited into people’s lives and trusted to document a meaningful moment in time. Shooting film became my way of slowing down. It invites a kind of meditation. After a frame, I reflect on the life of the image, what it captures, what it carries. Film keeps me present. It teaches me to honor the moment, which is something I’m trying to bring into everything I do.” @isla.manna

I learned how to make a pinhole camera and how to develop film. I think that changed me. I started photographing my surroundings, my travels and now I photograph lots of my amazing friends along with my love who all happen to be musicians. I noticed when going on tour there were no black women shooting, let alone any black women at shows at all. I think that helped me stick to capturing performance especially in Jazz, a Black American art form that has mostly white people running the festivals, the radio stations , the publications and even down to the management. 

“I want to keep being seen and amplifying others through capturing these events so people know this is Black and we belong here. This music has been put behind a paywall that not everyone can afford, gatekeeping the music that’s been made. I never thought my film photography could be impactful in this way, like some sort of historian. But then I work with many elders in Jazz, some of the best musicians of our time, and see how little is actually photographed! I just want to document the vibrations of these beautiful nights I get to experience. And there’s just a timelessness in Film that digital will never have. The feeling of the grain.

At this point I was living in a really small town in the middle of Mpumalanga, South Africa. There was no developing lab, no camera shops and very few resources, So I did what any Millennial with Gen Z siblings would do, I went searching at thrift stores and I bought any film camera I could find that I could afford. 

“It was actually so funny because I thought I knew photography. I had had an incredible education for about 6 years by this point under some of the countries most respected advertising, fashion and beauty photographers. I had always prided myself on my technical knowledge around gear, and the inner workings of the principles of
photography. Well, I was HUMBLED when I picked up my first film camera. The first one that I felt worked and that I still have to this day was a Minolta XG-A what seems to be a somewhat rare variation to the XG-M paired with a 50mm. Even though this is an aperture priority camera I still found myself so confused as to how to work the metering. My mentor had always said shoot one stop under for digital and one stop over for film. But what did that mean? I didn’t know what to set for ASA. Was that the same as ISO? Which ASA film do I get for what sunlight? Hell, I didn’t even know that I needed to get either black and white or colour film. I had such a mental block from the crossover from digital to film and the workings of it. 

“I must say that I am also one of those people who need to know WHY we do things before I can truly grasp a concept. So I became an ultra nerd and deep dived into the technicalities of film. I bought a variants of film and started on my path of discovery. What I can say is that my passion for photography had been reborn.” 🏳️‍⚧️Transgender Female Photographer, @nicole_louw_photography - pictured with her Voightlander Bessa R, paired with a Voigtlander Color-Skopar 35mm

Stomach bug, the flu, catching up at the lab, anxiety at level 12, and I still haven’t had time to go through the photos I took while away.

Huge thanks to everyone who’s stopped by, dropped off film, or ordered prints. I’m forever grateful that you trust me and the team at the lab to care for the photographs you’ve made. Shout out to everyone at the lab for holding things down while I was away. 

Thank you as well to everyone in Japan and South Korea who was so hospitable and generous with their time. It was great seeing you all and feeling energized by the incredible work being made. So many shows, books, zines, prints, and exhibitions, it’s inspiring.

If I owe you photos, I promise I’ll get them to you soon 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

Street photography Workshop
San Miguel de Allende, Mexico
with Juan Jose Reyes 
September 14-19, 2024
ONLY 2 SPOTS LEFT

​Join us for an exciting street photography workshop in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico with Juan Jose Reyes, founder and Executive Director of the Miami Street Photography Festival. This workshop is designed around the now-famous Five Levels and Three Styles of Street Photography method developed by Juan after ten years of working directly with world-class photographers at the Miami Street Photography Festival.

The picturesque town of San Miguel de Allende has been selected as "" Best City in the World"" by Travel and Leisure Magazine and named as one of the top recommended travel destinations. In 2008 San Miguel de Allende was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  

In Mexico, September is considered the “mes de la patria” (the month of the nation) because it is when they celebrate one of the most important holidays in their calendar, Independence Day (September 15th and 16th). All throughout the country there are celebrations, but in San Miguel de Allende, the festivities are extra important because of the role that Ignacio Allende played in Mexico’s fight for independence from Spain. Parades, music, patriotic fervor, dancing in the streets, men falling from tall poles with ropes around their ankles, bulls, beauty queens, and fireworks.   

  In this workshop, Juan will review basic and advanced concepts of street photography and how to create images that are interesting and compelling.  He will teach a framework for shooting and editing street photography designed to help you identify photos with the potential to win photo contests based on Juan's experience overseeing the judging panel of the largest street photography contest in the world, The Miami Street  Photography Festival contest, which is widely recognized as the event that showcases the best of contemporary street photography.",105,5,

東京カメラ部2024写真展。4日間の開催、大盛況のうち閉幕となりました。ご来場頂いた皆様はもちろんのこと、その中でも自分の写真に足を止めて頂いた方、さらには興味を持って話しかけてくださった方、色んな方がおりましたがどの方々にも本当に感謝を申し上げたいです。この度は本当にありがとうございました。

「新10選として」みたいな気持ちは全くなく、ただただ、東京カメラ部写真展という枠組みの中で、4枚の写真と与えられたテーブルの中で、自己の表現を損なわぬ粒度で、体験の拡張を模索した形が今回の展示でした（勿論、断念したこともあります。）これらの解説は、実際お聞きいただいた方ならわかると思いますが、この場で記すにはあまりにも膨大なので、ここではテーブルに置いたステートメントとタイトルのみ記載しておき、皆様の想像力に委ねるまでとしたいと思います。
* ご質問などあればコメントに書いて頂いて大丈夫です👌

また、写真仲間の皆様も4日間ほんとうにありがとうございました！バタバタしてて中には全然絡めなかった人もいたのが悔やまれるのですが、少ない時間でも構ってくれたりイジってくれたりと嬉しかったです。

最後に、これを見られているかわかりませんが、運営の方々にも感謝を。このような舞台を与えて下さってありがとうございました。ここから生まれるであろう、新しいクリエイティブと未来には期待せざるを得ません。そして、これからもどうぞ、よろしくお願いします。

あの場にあった全ての探究がさらに深く輝くことを願って。

▼多視点と認知
普段から撮る物に明確なくくりは無く、ひたすら歩いて、見て、何気ない場所で惹きつけられた瞬間を撮っています。一見関連の無い写真ばかりに見えるかもしれません。しかし注意深く観察しているとしばしば興味深い物が浮かび上がってくる事に気づくのです。
今回セレクトした写真には様々な「視点」が潜んでいます。また、個々の写真だけでなく俯瞰する事で見つかる視点もあります。それらを「認知」し提示する事が今回の展示の起点であり、もう一方で閲覧者側にこれらの視点が認知される事で、ご自身の写真への認知・帰着となる事。その行為全体を通した相互作用が今回のテーマです。この展示が、見てくださった方に何かを示し、繰り返し見てもらう度に新たな発見に繋がるきっかけとなれば幸いです。",3,43,東京カメラ部2024写真展 | この世界とともに | StreetPhotography | streetshot | streetphotographer | Streetphotographers | streetshooter | streetsnap | candidstreet | urbanexploration | Fujifilmxseries | grsnaps | streetmoment | streetianity | streets_unseen | bcncollective | street_avengers | street_macadam | urbanphotography | SPiCollective | SPi_colour | streetdreamsmag | unionmagazine

The first photo features umbrellas and clothing with a floral theme, primarily in red and purple. In the second photo, you’ll notice that flowers are also the main subject, with the same red and purple color scheme. The third photo is a combination of these elements, presented as a series.

These images were taken during “GR meet 47,” an event organized by RICOH GR Teams. I had the honor of participating as a guest, and although the weather turned into a steady rain, I was inspired by the attendees who embraced even the bad weather and turned it into part of the experience.

Thank you to everyone who joined! RICOH will be sharing an official event report soon, so please stay tuned for that as well.

1枚目は、花を基調とした傘とお洋服が赤と紫であること。 そして2枚目も、花が主体であり、赤と紫で構成されていることがわかるでしょうか。 3枚目は、それらを組み合わせた組写真です。

これらの写真は、RICOH GRの公式が主催するイベント「GR meet47」の中で撮影されたものです。今回、私はゲストとして参加させていただきましたが、当日はしっかりとした雨になったものの、その悪天候すらも楽しみに変えている参加者の姿を見て、私も背中を押されました。皆様、ご参加ありがとうございました。今後、RICOHからもレポートが上がる予定ですので、そちらも楽しみにお待ちいただけたらと思います。

遅ればせながらお礼を。​​平日という中でもたくさんの方にお集まり頂きありがとうございました。準備は試行錯誤の繰り替えしでしたが、「日常の中での発見」や「フィルムシミュレーションの使い方の発見」、どちらも「発見」というキーワードを軸に駆け足でお話しさせて頂きました。
任された時間がとても短い事もありうまく伝わったかは心配なところもありますが、今回の内容が皆様の写真生活の中で少しでもお役に立つようであれば幸いです。
​​　
​​※様々な事情があって叶わなかった事もあるので、機会いただけるようであればまた次回に！（なので、皆様の応援も引き続きよろしくお願いします。）

​​[CP+ 2025 FUJIFILM Booth – Thank You for Coming!]

​​Thank you to everyone who attended, even on a weekday. Despite the limited time I was given, I went through a lot of trial and error during the preparation process. In the end, I focused on the theme of “Discovery,” sharing insights on “Discoveries in Everyday Life” and “Discoveries in Using Film Simulations,” albeit at a rather fast pace. I sincerely hope that the session offered even a small piece of inspiration for your photography journey.
​​I originally wanted to dive deeper into comparing different Film Simulations, but due to time constraints, it was challenging to cover everything in detail. If I have another opportunity in the future, I’d love to explore it more thoroughly. (So, I’d truly appreciate your continued support and encouragement!)
​​
​​Looking ahead, I still have more events on the horizon. I would be delighted to see you again at one of them. Wishing you all the best in your photography adventures!

​​日本で最大規模のカメライベントであるCP+が2025年も開催されます。その会場内の、富士フイルムのブースに登壇させて頂くことになりました。CP+は私が写真を撮り始めた初心者の頃から何回も行っていたイベントですので、そのステージに自分が参加する事になることは、夢のような機会でありとても光栄な事です。
​​
​​内容は、撮影した写真の話と、フィルムシミュレーションの使い方が中心になる予定です。種類が多くてよくわからない、という人いるんじゃないでしょうか。私は普段からRAW現像ではなくカメラ内部の現像を駆使してますので、皆さんが参考になるような実用的なヒントみたいなものが共有できればと思っています。

​​The largest camera event in Japan, CP+ 2025, will be held once again! I’m honored to announce that I’ll be speaking at the Fujifilm booth during the event. CP+ is an event I’ve attended many times since I first started photography as a beginner, so having the opportunity to be on stage feels like a dream come true and a great honor.
​​
​​My talk will focus on discussing my photography and how to make the most of Fujifilm’s Film Simulations. With so many options available, some of you may find it difficult to choose the right one. Since I personally rely on in-camera processing rather than RAW development, I hope to share some practical tips that you’ll find useful.
​​
​​The session is scheduled for Friday, February 28th, from 13:40‐14:10 (JST). It’s on a weekday, but if you can find time, I’d be thrilled to see you there!

〈 Announcement 〉
As one of the Tokyo Camera Club’s 10 Viral Photographers for 2023, I am thrilled to announce my participation in the Tokyo Camera Club 2024 Photo Exhibition. Four works including new works will be exhibited. Also, my photo books and zines will be displayed on a table set up. If anyone living in Japan sees this, please see me.

My zine is currently limited to shipping only to Japan, but after this exhibition is over, I plan to ship worldwide. A few issues need to be addressed before I deliver the zine from Japan to you, so I will make a clear announcement when the time comes. Hope some of you like this.

Whether outside taking photos or just enjoying the scenery, my brain constantly imagines multiple shooting plans. In particular, I often take silhouettes, but I have noticed that I often add to them a variety of reflections.
I can’t explain it well yet, but I feel that multiplying these plans gives strength to our photos.
A behind-the-scenes video of this picture could be shown at another time✌️

Currently, I use the latest XF56mm F1.2 R WR, and I shoot with the X-T5 because it is the only body that can fully demonstrate the descriptive qualities of the lens.
When writing this post, the latest film simulation available on the X-T5 is Nostalgic Nega. The overall tone is amber, so it strangely brought the atmosphere together even in locations with cluttered colors. One of the key points is that the shadow is very persistent and retains detail even when sunk very deep, so that even dramatic silhouettes such as the one in this photo can be seen in the atmosphere of people passing by. The ability to change shadow and highlight parameters in increments of 0.5 from the X-E4 and later models has also had a significant effect. In this photo, highlights are set to +1.5, shadows to +1, and WB shifts to R+6 B-1 to emphasize the impression of dusk.

The city of Tokyo is filled with buildings. The light that shines through the gaps between them is amazing and I personally love it. The light in the early morning is particularly special. There are some photos that only those who can get up early can take.

The video on the second slide here shows the exact moment, how fleeting it really was, a real split second I could never have planned in advance.

Although I've been photographing the solstice at Stonehenge for several years now it was only last year that I made anything half decent, and I'm hoping to better that this time around.

I'm taking 18 rolls including two currently already loaded in my cameras.

This was a fantastic morning, and I quickly finished a roll during the rehearsal, which can be seen in the first five frames here.

The final four images are damaged due to jamming in the camera, taken after the parade had finished. It was later in the day that I realised this had occurred, and thanks to @jkirbyphotos letting me use his backpack as a makeshift darkbag I was able to salvage these photographs.

Frustrating, but part of an unpredictable process. The worst feeling was having to write emails to some of the people I had promised portraits to letting them know they didn't come out.",3,11,

The special thing about these is that for casting these I used some very old Korean cutlery in 990 silver that my parents used to have when I was little. They were always stored away in a cupboard in the dining room, and I remember very clearly and vividly that I was never allowed to touch them but every time my parents left home, I would secretly go downstairs into the dining room and open the doors to the cupboard and look at them and hold them in my hands, but I think I never ate with them secretly. I remember like it was yesterday that I was so fascinated by them. But I always got into trouble with my parents caught me with them. It was a couple of chopsticks and spoons  and last year my mom brought them to berlin because my parents had no use for them, which they actually never had so I thought it was the perfect time to turn them into something very symbolic something that reminds me of my childhood years and my years living at home and turned them into silver rings that I can wear whenever I want to

So these are very unique pieces since the silver are used for them is irreplaceable. Yeah you can see how I work on them cutting them out of the casting tree as they have been cast in one single mold sand them oxidize them and give them their finishing touch.",3,0,

Finally I got to take the velodrom in berlin as a location and it worked! 

Again this is another chapter in my „dyxtopia“ project, where I deal with parts of my biggest anxieties, that are about the future of mankind, the vanishing of the human soul and spirit, the influence of AI  in particular I find the currently trending generated images by midjourney etc very unsettling since there is nothing g human about them but the apparent human form they depict. So I set out to draw that artificial vision back into the hands of humanity. The ideas that are being generated are interesting though and give enough significance for further examination. 
My ever present penchant for dystopia and post apocalyptic universes fueled the search for the right vision in this shoot immensely. 

So thank you very much for the cooperation, the incredible jewelry I got to involve by @2819jewelry (CHECK HIM OUT!), the great modeling and trusting in my vision and weird ideas to @vonyx.dossier and of course spsecial thanks go out to @wastxdart @danielalexanderweiter for bts material and being a helping hand when I needed some help, because I really was all over the place to maintain focus. 🫶

I can’t wait to get to work on these! It was so much fun!",3,7,

I’ve decided to make an insta for my jewelry. The numbers of it are growing and I want to maintain some clarity here in my work and different endeavours of exploring things within my art. Of which there is greater diversity (omg maga people) as some of you may have noticed. 
I’m currently in the stage of photographing and cataloging the unique pieces I made and it will be up soon. So if you like what I do and want to see more, you can follow @ozzybjewlz . I’d love to welcome you there in a different world of my funny brains self expression. 
This picture means very much to me as the shooting I had with the handsome and genial @helg_yan was the first time I put my jewelry on someone else for a shoot. @henrysteyer.ig followed! 🫶 
it’s been so nice to have so many comments and critiques about my pieces! For it is not exactly a inexpensive Endeavour as some might know. 
But enough of the bla bla. If you like the unique pieces I make, you will soon see more of them over there, as I am expanding my jewelry work with some exciting new ideas. Love you guys! 🖤",3,0,
https://www.instagram.com/p/DLxNgz4IiFe/,ozzybphotography,2025-07-06,img1 | img2 | img3 | img4 | img5 | img6 | img7,"So this ongoing and evolving project is one about a very distinctive glimpse into the future depicting visions of the evolution of mankind and humanity with emblematic archetypes of what today’s technological and societal developments in their fledging stages will transform us into. I say will. Not might. Because it is inevitable. 
For these works I rely heavily on the people I work with and their inner personal storytelling and past when dealing with this vision and topic. 
I intentionally leave much more room for improvisation in whatever direction. 
Personally I realized that I never really dealt with „the future“ in my photography I always reached into the past. Even catching someone in a moment instantly turns into your construct of the past. So I was glad for my theatrical background 🤘 
I’ve always been haunted by dystopian visions of our future in my life time. And as my brain is somewhat predetermined to look for and identify patterns and systems I do see certain signs in today’s ongoings. So I finally felt I’ve got to reach into the future. 

This is a preview. I’m still working on a lot of shots. But the final series is not compiled yet. But as I feel that every edited shot is a story standing on its own I decided to publish and post on the way. 
Finally I have reason to keep up with today’s fast-pace which I always refused to submit to. So. There you go!

Huge thanks to the incredible model @revan_paliukh @izaio.development who came over to shoot even though it was his first day of permanently staying in berlin! Right from the airport and fashionweek fittings ❤️ thanks bro 👊🙏",3,2,preview | dyxtopia

Simon is an award-winning photographer and lecturer at Glasgow Kelvin College. His work ranges from portraits of the Dalai Lama to musicians such as Noel Gallagher, Paolo Nutini and Primal scream’s Bobby Gillespie. He also shoots human interest stories that have taken him to countries such as Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and Colombia.

Over the last 16 years, Simon has captured the diverse community of Govanhill, giving an insight into one of Scotland’s most diverse areas which is a mixing pot of cultures and ethnicities.

His work from the project has won several awards, including: The @mpbcom @scotartsawards Scottish Portrait Awards, The @sonyworldphoto Prize, @portrait_of_humanity, and The @barturphoto_award.

He said: “I’m really excited to bring part of this project to Stirling for the Festival and see if it will connect outside of Glasgow. 

“Personally, I feel the themes of ‘Belonging and Connection’ are universal. Especially in times where fear and exclusion seem to be a driving force, it’s important to open up and consider life from other’s perspectives. These portraits won’t give any answers but my hope is that they might trigger small reflections and maybe even lower a few barriers.”

In partnership with @streetlevelphotoworks, Govanhill will be open at @macrobertartscentre from 20th August until 20th September 2025. Simon will also be hosting a talk at his exhibition, stay tuned as a date for this will be announced soon!

For just over a year I have been working with the teachers and pupils of my old secondary school to produce a photographic project celebrating the diversity of a Scottish high school. The support from the foundation will be used to undertake workshops and buy disposable cameras for  a group of pupils who will then bring their own visual voice to the project. The goal is to exhibit the work in summer of 2026. Many thanks to the foundation for the continued support of analogue photography. @kpss_news @kpss_modernlanguages,917,68,simonmurphyphotographer | richardandsiobhanphotographyfoundation

A few years back , photographer and writer Tracy Calder @tracy_calder_photo interviewed me for B+W photography magazine on my Govanhill project. It was brilliant to catch up again and talk about the necessity of living a creative life for her podcast “We need to make things”. Tracy’s enthusiasm is infectious and our conversation also reminded me about the importance of surrounding yourself with people that don’t necessarily have the same thoughts as you (how boring would that be?) but those who sharpen each other and ignite sparks due to their openness, energy and understanding of how essential creativity is to living. Especially in difficult times, where creative pursuits seem trivial to many and often the first thing to be dropped , it’s actually art ( music, painting, photography, poetry etc etc) that can fill the void and helps give a more rounded perspective. 

We touch on loads of topic’s connected with creative living on the podcast and there is some chat about some of the latest projects that I’ve been working on. Link to the podcast in my bio. Thank you Tracy!

For Episode 5 of We Need to Make Things I chat with Simon Murphy @smurph77 about his chapter approach to long-term projects, creative morning routines, photographing strangers, and where on earth you can buy a spacesuit, among many other things.

Simon is a photographer, lecturer and chair of the Scottish Portrait Awards. Over the years, he’s travelled extensively documenting human interest stories in countries such as Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Cambodia.

His portraiture subjects range from the Dalai Lama to Noel Gallagher and John Hurt. Simon has won numerous awards and exhibited extensively. His first book, Govanhill, was published in 2023.

This episode is full of Simon’s wonderful wisdom including:

👉 How to stay motivated while working on major projects
👉 Why writing should be part of your morning routine
👉 The best way to approach, and be honest, with strangers
👉 Why rejection is rarely personal

‘Life’ does not always mean being alive. Capturing the perfect moments with a camera shutter conveys both the animate 
and inanimate, documenting them in photographs and transmitting those messages through paper via ""Photobook The 
Animals"". We cannot deny that they live around us - a cow with horns as roads, a cat wearing a turret hat, a giraffe 
empathizing with people, and a dog pee as a rainbow. I hope everyone slowly turns each page and immerses with all the 
animals in this photobook. 
""This Photobook is a collection of street photographs related to animals, including various animal statues, over my 10 years 
of street photography. I enjoy taking pictures of animals, observing their behaviors, guessing their thoughts, and waiting to 
capture the right moment, even though it is tough to be expected.""

[ปกหลัง]
2014-2024

Over the past 10 years, we have been deeply captivated by street photography. It has introduced us to diverse people, bringing both joy and emotional struggles along the way. Some images leave us uncertain whether we could ever capture them again, which reflects not only the difficulty of street photography but also its profound value

ตลอดระยะเวลา 10 ปี เราหลงไหลการถ่ายภาพสตรีทอย่างถอนตัวไม่ขึ้น ภาพสตรีททำให้เราได้พบเจอผู้คนที่หลากหลาย มอบความสุขและความทุกข์ทางด้านจิตใจอยู่ตลอดเวลา ภาพบางภาพเราเองก็ไม่มั่นใจว่าจะบันทึกได้อีกมั้ย นั้นหมายความว่าภาพสตรีทมีความยากและมีคุณค่ามากเช่นกัน

@gokhanarer 

Some frames arrive like a coincidence, but land like a punchline.
This photo is a perfect example of visual wit in street photography — where timing, light, and a slice of everyday absurdity collide in a split second. The fabric with bold embroidered eyes creates an uncanny illusion, turning a mundane street moment into a surreal spectacle.
It’s not just a shot — it’s a reminder that the street is always performing; you just have to be ready to press the shutter when it does.

Ricoh GRii - Instagram has distorted the landscape image when uploaded. 

Sadly, I had very little time to explore and shoot in Gothenburg as my main reason for being there  was to attend the wonderful GSPF! 

I did manage to grab this while out looking for a decent coffee on my first morning there.

Highly recommend attending the festival. Very well organised event and super nice ppl too! My wife and I had a ball and would certainly look at attending again if we found ourselves in that part of the world when it was on! I would suggest staying on a few days afterwards to explore this wonderful city.

I saw this beautifully dressed gentlemen walking down the street holding a copy of the Sydney Morning Herald. It was  like he'd stepped out of a time portal from the 1950's into today....

I can't decide if I prefer the colour or BNW version. Let me know what you prefer and any thoughts on the image.

Taken on a recent catch up with @juliacoddington
@linda_maclean_
Lovely catching up with you both 🖤

I never wanted to spend the time processing my images because it took me away from the utter joy I had walking and photographing the streets of Sydney. 

I'm finding going through the images I took while living there incredibly tough as I so want to be walking it's streets again. Living, feeling, breathing and capturing every heart beat of this wonderful city.

Oh how I miss you Sydney. 😪

I found the experience quite fascinating, with the men  and women and children separated throughout the event. It was like shooting two completely different events with the two sides divided by a curtain. The men’s side was very somber, religious and serious. The boy or Bar Mitzvah, which translates to “son of the commandment”. This signifies that he has reached the age of religious maturity, has to read a passage from the Torah, with rabbis taking turns to read and speak to the people in attendance. 
The women and children’s side in stark contrast is much like an event I’m used to, with laughter, gossip and children running around. I enjoyed it most when the Bar Mitzvah did his reading and the mother and sisters took a cheeky look through the curtain.

I’ve shot two Torah scroll inaugurations, four Purims , some family events and a recent bar mitzvah. I’m very aware of the fact that I’ve been very lucky, as someone that’s not Jewish to get this access to this very religious community. This isolated community is very detached from the outside world, in away we are looking at a community from the past, they don’t use smart phones, don’t have TVs in their houses, internet access is limited. The children play on the streets on bikes, and scooters. Material possessions are rare to see in a child’s bedroom or any part of the household for that matter. Religious study is just a part of life. They celebrate , laugh, drink, and socialise and spend a lot of time at community events. We can learn a lot from how they live.",6795,443,hasidic | jewish | orthodox | stamfordhill

Tradisi Perang Obor adalah upacara adat tahunan yang dilaksanakan di Desa Tegalsambi, Jepara, Jawa Tengah, khususnya pada malam Senin Pahing setelah panen raya, yang juga bertepatan dengan bulan Dzulhijjah dalam kalender Jawa. Tradisi ini melibatkan aksi saling pukul menggunakan obor yang terbuat dari pelepah daun kelapa kering yang diikat pada bambu. 
.
Perang Obor dimaknai sebagai wujud syukur kepada Tuhan atas hasil panen dan keselamatan, serta sebagai upaya tolak bala atau penangkal musibah. 
.
.
“The Perang Obor tradition is an annual cultural ceremony held in Tegalsambi Village, Jepara, Central Java, usually on the Monday night of the Javanese Pahing week following the harvest season, which also coincides with the month of Dzulhijjah in the Javanese calendar. The tradition involves participants striking each other with torches made from dried coconut palm fronds tied to bamboo sticks.”
.
“Perang Obor is seen as an expression of gratitude to God for the harvest and safety, as well as a ritual to ward off misfortune or disasters.”

Mixing up three visits to New York, in no particular order, or rather, I can’t decide, but the first one provides a title, perhaps.

An afterthought: six of these photos feature mobile phones, illustrating how this device has transformed the look of many street photographs. I’m stating the obvious, but it’s fascinating how such a change alters body language.

A hastily gathered collection of photographs by Gianni Berengo Gardin, who recently passed away. 

_______

I wrote about the first photograph in Street Photography: A History in 100 Iconic Images:

Hans-Michael Koetzie in Photographers A-Z (2011) makes the following claim for Gianni Berengo Gardin: 

“Undoubtedly the most important photographer in Italy in the latter part of the 20th century”

Such an assertion edges out Mario Giacomelli, but Giacomelli never seemingly sought a world stage; his artistic expression was essentially small-town Italy and his abstract world within it. Gardin’s work, by comparison, is more generous, more travelled and extroverted, but his Italian photos are born of pride and rooted in a classic tradition of black and white photography. Names such as Robert Doisneau, Edouard Boubat, Willy Ronis, and, naturally, Henri Cartier-Bresson fly around Gardin. He’s been called the ‘Italian Catrier-Bresson.’

Here, a child runs across Piazza San Marco in Venice, the scene intensified by a blanket of snow and the striking contrast of black on white. The pigeons in flight form a background everywhere. The nearly uniform pattern highlights the figure of the child. She is also in motion, but her wings are rooted to the ground. Everything converges on the running black shape of the child; the pigeons surround her, but she remains the focal point of the photograph.

Thanks here to @davidsolomons and especially the video from @sofiapratasmorais. The video is not perfect, but I like that.

A Love Story. 

I’m in the centre of London, experimenting again with double-exposure shots. The first exposure features a love sign, and nearby, I notice a guy across the street. It’s the hat that caught my attention. I linger too long and try another set of shots, but clearly, he sees me. He approaches angrily and asks something like WTF are you photographing me and then grabs my camera. We hold onto it together; I don’t let go, and he rages, threatening to smash my camera. He demands I take the film out, but I tell him it’s a digital camera.

More rage follows; we’re not fighting, but it’s getting close. I tell him I will delete the photo, and I do, but I only delete one of the double exposures I’ve taken. I’m holding onto this one, thinking I won’t delete it, and I start making excuses about the battery running out. In the end, I let him see all the images from the day. The photos are too small, and he’s somewhat bamboozled; he can’t properly concentrate. He does not see this remaining image. 

He tells me that he’s just done ‘bird’ and something about being on crack. And he starts to calm down. I never lose my cool; I could have easily done so. God knows what I would have done if he had managed to smash my camera. Somehow, he starts to show me his art on his phone. It’s not my thing, but it’s good. I tell him he’s got talent. Finally, he lets me go, or rather, I walk away. I tell him he has a great hat and that’s why I photographed him. 

I’m full of love for him.",326,16,

A disparate bunch of photos, the link is that they are all taken with Kodak transparency film. Something about that film lifts them, regardless of the usual merits. I wish I had taken more.

I know it's practice, because the parents don't sound the alarm they just keep eating.Today I'm feeding the crows and a Coopers hawk and a young crow go whizzing by me chasing each other. Nobody seemed to care, and they land next to each other on the fence and two more hawks land on the fence, three young Cooper's hawks, and a half a dozen of my young juvenile crows all sitting together. I run down to get pictures and proof finally, the adults eating in the field followed me as the hawks and young crows started chasing each other again. The  crows and the hawks all land together in the plum orchard in the middle of the park, right next to each other. I was able to walk right up to them because they were taking cues from the crows. At one point the two hummingbirds that hang with the crows even joined in chasing with the crows diving the hawks tail, then all would return to the trees together to rest. One of the hawks tried to push a crow out of his spot and he just shooed him away like a kid and the hawk landed a couple feet away and started preening.",8,1,

https://www.instagram.com/p/DK9XbXfoSml/,streetlevelphotos,2025-06-16,img1,"📸 Reflections in the City
Sometimes the best compositions are hidden in plain sight—like this mirrored view of Tower Bridge, captured in London on a moody morning.

This shot was taken with my @sony.unitedkingdom A7IV + 24mm GM lens, and edited in Lightroom to enhance the depth, tones, and symmetry. What made this frame pop was the clean vertical reflection off a modern glass building directly opposite the iconic structure.

🔍 Tips for Capturing Great Reflections:
	1.	Scout with intent – Look for reflective surfaces like windows, puddles, polished stone, or metal. Urban architecture is full of them!
	2.	Get close & experiment – The closer your lens is to the reflective surface, the more seamless and dramatic the mirror effect.
	3.	Mind your angles – Slight tilts can break the illusion. Keep your camera as parallel as possible to the surface.
	4.	Watch your light – Overcast skies (like this day!) work great—they reduce harsh glare and help pull out the finer details.
	5.	Look for symmetry – Reflections often shine when they echo structure, leading lines, or balance in the scene.

Reflections are all about seeing the city differently—literally and creatively. Let the streets tell their story twice. ✨",248,27,StreetPhotography | LondonPhotography | TowerBridge | ReflectionPhotography | UrbanReflections | SonyAlpha | SonyA7IV | 24mmGM | StreetLeagues | Cityscape | ArchitecturePhotography | LondonViews | VisualAmbassadors | ShotOnSony | StreetPhotographers | IG_London | UrbanExploration | PhotographyTips | ReflectionsOfTheCity | SymmetryHunters

Spotted this golden moment while sipping a flat white on the Embankment… and just had to interrupt the coffee to grab the camera. Shot this beauty of The Shard through a café window, framed by silhouetted leaves and bathed in that buttery London sunset glow. Honestly? Worth the caffeine sacrifice. 😅

Shot on my @sony.unitedkingdom A7IV with the absolute powerhouse @tamron_uk 35-150mm, and polished in Lightroom to really let the warmth of golden hour sing 🎨🔥

🔍 Pro Tips for Sunset Shoots in London:
	1.	Embankment (where this was taken!) offers stunning views of both sides of the Thames, especially in golden hour.
	2.	St Paul’s Cathedral Terrace – catch the dome with dramatic skies.
	3.	Primrose Hill – for wide, elevated skyline shots.
	4.	Tower Bridge Walkway – city lights meet the river as the sun dips.
	5.	Greenwich Park – killer view of the Canary Wharf skyline at dusk.

✨ Light changes FAST in London, especially on overcast days, so set up early and always shoot RAW for maximum editing power later.

As night falls over London, its layers of history reveal themselves in dramatic contrast. In this frame, the ancient White Tower, part of the Tower of London, stands resolute—bathed in subtle, golden light—while the modern Shard pierces the sky just behind, its glass crown glowing like a beacon of the future.

This is the magic of London: old and new side by side, telling stories centuries apart in a single glance.

📸 Shot handheld with available light and minimal post-processing—because sometimes, the city’s natural contrast does the heavy lifting.

🌙 3 Top Tips for Shooting Night Photography in London:
	1.	Use What the City Gives You
London’s ambient lighting—from street lamps to high-rise glows—creates natural vignettes. Use them to frame or backlight your subjects for drama without needing flash.
	2.	Work with Reflections
Rainy nights aren’t a curse—they’re a gift. Wet pavements reflect light and architecture beautifully, so embrace the weather and go shoot!
	3.	Stay Safe and Be Aware
London is stunning at night, but some areas empty quickly after dark. Stick to well-lit spots, go with a buddy, and always keep an eye on your surroundings (and gear).",163,20,londonatnight | nightphotography | toweroflondon | londonbynight | streetphotography | urbanexploration | cityscape | shardlondon | moodygrams | nightshooters | ig_london | historicplaces | ukphotography | lowlightphotography | photographylovers | streetphotographers | capturestreets | modernvshistoric | londonlife | nightlights

There’s nothing quite like capturing a red London double-decker with St Paul’s standing proud in the background – a true quintessential London shot.

Shot on a perfect sunny day, the reds really popped, and I knew I had to wait for just the right moment to frame it all up. Like buses, these shots never come when you want them… then three come at once. 😅

📷 Taken on my Sony A7IV with the beastly Tamron 35-150mm, sitting snug on my Benro tripod, and using a Tide Optics ND filter to keep those highlights in check.

⸻

💡Photographer Tips for This Spot:
	1.	Best time to shoot: Early morning or late afternoon for golden light and less foot traffic.
	2.	Tripod essential: Especially for sharp long exposures or precision composition.
	3.	Watch your backdrop: Wait for a clean moment when the bus is clear of clutter – timing is everything here.
	4.	Use a longer focal length to compress the background and really bring St Paul’s forward.
	5.	Patience is your best friend – buses are unpredictable, tourists are everywhere, and the light changes fast. Bring snacks. 😎

Caught this dramatic scene from the South Bank, right as an iconic red double-decker rolled across the bridge — perfectly framed against the brooding skyline of the City of London. That shadowy light? Total chef’s kiss. 🌫️✨

Shot on my @sony.unitedkingdom A7IV paired with the @tamron_uk 35-150mm f/2.8 — easily one of my favourite combos for urban shooting. The compression and clarity at 150mm really pulled those towers in for that layered look I love. 😍

London’s architecture is a mix of past and future, and I wanted this frame to tell both stories — the familiar red bus we all know, and the glass giants that define the modern city.

If you’re ever out here shooting:
🔹 Look for contrast — light vs shadow, old vs new
🔹 Use a longer focal length to compress space and drama
🔹 Wait for the “moment” — a bus, a bird, a beam of light — it makes the scene
